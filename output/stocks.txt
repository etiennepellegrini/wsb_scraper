I've always tried to be money conscious but still wind up buying so many things and it all adds up.\n\nNow I think about things in terms of how many shares of xyz company I could invest it in instead, like that new game is 2 shares SPCE, the new camera I really don't need is 3 shares of AMD, etc... For me it's a really powerful perspective I never had before.", 34, '/r/stocks/comments/kf9zuv/i_wasted_all_my_money_until_i_started_buying/gg79a41/'])

AI     m=    61, s=   453 (post: I said it: no idea how the stock market works. Tesla sold 400,000 cars up 700%, Pfizer has the globe literally as a customer but they are only up by 12%, comment: ["Elon is a nice blend of economic-conservatism and progressive on social issues.\n\nHe's technically a moderate independent, but if he were to run I'd see him running as a libertarian.\n\nIgnoring the obvious that he can't be President due to being from Africa.\n\nElon is an innovator, and the government is the antithesis of innovation. It's bureaucratic, inefficient and moves at a snails pace. \n\nElon is not really too concerned about social issues that he can't engineer a solution for like systemic inequality.\n\nHe's more concerned with developing AI, and making humans an interplanetary species. Turning his Sci-Fi dreams into a reality, disproving a verbally abusive dad who said he would never become anything. SpaceX employees have quit their jobs because they can't visit their families because Elon is also having them work overtime. To him their sacrifice serves the greater good in his eyes. but then again Elon can afford nannies, maids, and his own teachers to take care of his many kids so he can work 24/7 on his many projects instead. The average SpaceX employee doesn't have those same resources.\n\nHe's not a great public speaker, but looking at Trump, thats not really a pre-requisite to be POTUS. \n\nElon is better off continuing to lobby democrats and republicans while the government leaves him alone so he can progress society trough technological advancement.", 11, '/r/stocks/comments/kfrt6z/i_said_it_no_idea_how_the_stock_market_works/ggc9zbk/'])
