TSLA   m=   303, s=  3202 (post: Beware: Motley Fool Stock Advisor seems to be a pump scheme, comment: ['To be honest the Stock Advisor newsletter from Motley Fool is the best money I spent in like 5 -8 years or so that I was subscribed. Every year I had it I beat the market. I dont buy every stock that they recommend but most of the stocks in my portfolio I received from them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I got in super early in TSLA at split adjusted price of $6 lol because it was mentioned by Motley Fools\n\nAMZN, MELI, FB, NFLX, NVDA, etc. If you had invested in some of the companies they have put in their newsletter when it first came out, you would be very wealthy lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt really sounds like you made a quick judgement, or an assumption with very few data to back it up. There are not enough followers of Motley Fools to be able to move the needle that much in my opinion. While I do notice a lot of the stocks that they recommend tend to be up by the time they announced it, but this can be because the stocks they recommend have more up days than  down days on average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt could also possibly be that they have several picks ready and release the ones that are green that day to possibly look better? There are many reasons this could be. Your small sample of data is too small to conclude on, I hope you dont use this type of analysis to choose stocks.', 62, '/r/investing/comments/kffz8a/beware_motley_fool_stock_advisor_seems_to_be_a/gg8jksz/'])

Just because you announce how you will have all these ideas realized ranging from cool to whacky doesn\'t make it instantly so. People don\'t buy FSD for what it is right now, they buy it because Elon has been claiming for years now that true full self driving is just around the corner and they have to BUY RIGHT NOW...!!! before it\'s too late or they will really regret not buying in at this "discount". \n\nAll major companies have the things in the works that Tesla claims they are about to have, except those companies have an image to lose and can\'t drop alpha products on the market and constantly break their own promises.\n\nTesla is running on the good will of it\'s fans.
