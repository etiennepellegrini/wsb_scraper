TSLA   m=     8, s=   215 (post: An Investor's Conference with Cathie Woods (Too Spicy for WSB), comment: ["An Investor's Conference with Cathie Woods (Too Spicy for WSB)  The December air was cold as I emerged from the Broadway & 28th subway station onto the streets of New York. Double checking the directions, I nervously began to walk down East 28th street to my destination. There was a good reason for my anxiousness. For you see, today was an incredibly special day for me; I was to visit the headquarters of one of the best actively-managed ETFs in the United States, ARK Invest. Their focus on disruptive, cutting-edge innovation investment had captivated me six months ago when, hungry for exposure to the hot action in emerging industries, I noticed their inordinately large exposure to TSLA and many other companies. The fact that they also had a trailing return that was over double a traditional boomer benchmark was also incredibly arousing. \n\nExcited by the dual prospect of exposure to up-and-coming companies and busty returns, I decided to buy into ARKK, and now sat at a princely 60% return-on-investment since entering. I was filled with hot feelings of gratitude, and owed it all to the wisdom of one special woman; Cathie Woods, founder and CEO of ARK Invest. Overcome with these feelings, I tweeted a picture of my portfolio value to her and a message of thanks for her forward-looking investments and a wish for continued success. \n\nTo my shock, she sent me a direct message thanking me for my feelings and congratulating me on my success. ‚ÄúIt makes me happy that it isn‚Äôt just those big, stuffy hedge funds that are buying ARKK. / Even small portfolios can benefit from our unique approach to investing.‚Äù Our conversation continued along those lines, until once again Cathie delivered another massive shock; ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about having a press release with retail investors, to show off investors like you as examples of the micro success of our strategies. / Would you be interested in coming to our office for the ARKK experience?‚Äù How could I turn down an invitation from my personal idol? I sold some of the SPY shares I was holding, since they were barely doing anything, and booked a ticket to JFK at once.\n\nAnd now here I was, standing in front of the offices of the woman who would make my wildest investment fantasies come true. I braced myself and entered the fairly unassuming building. With no elevator, I was forced to climb seven flights of stairs and with each flight, my anxiety only grew. Was this all some sort of sick joke by an intern running Cathie‚Äôs Twitter account? Would I arrive and be laughed at for being the dude who had to bandwagon off smarter people because I couldn‚Äôt do my own investing? By the time I reached the top of the stairs, my tension was at its peak. I hesitated before the door, but decided that after all, you only live once. If I was being jerked around, I would take my jerking like a man.\n\nEntering the reception room, the young man sitting at the reception desk glanced up at me with a bored look. ‚ÄúGood morning, what can I do for you today?‚Äù Feeling slightly embarrassed, I told him that I was here for the micro investors conference organized by Cathie Woods. As I said that, his expression shifted and he straightened up. ‚ÄúBy any chance, are you Mr. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*?‚Äù I said that I was. ‚ÄúPlease have a seat, Ms. Woods has been anxiously awaiting your arrival.‚Äù Taking a seat, I decided to kill some time calling people in my favorite options gambling server stupid for not understanding the fundamental rule of buying low and selling high. While doing so, I noticed that the receptionist was stealing inquisitive glances at me over the desk, and even calling people retarded ended up being unable to assuage my worries.\n\nJust as I considered getting up and leaving, she appeared. Sporting a subdued gray wool sweater and black pants, Cathie strode into the reception room. Tossing her cropped auburn hair, glasses glinting, she was as magnificent in person as her pictures suggested. Everything about her posture, stride and aura confirmed my intense feelings of devotion for her revolutionary focus on technologically enabled disruption across all economic sectors. Though she was 64, she had the same energy as a woman a third of her age. Only the iron will that I had cultivated diamond handing SPAC plays kept me from kneeling and kissing the impeccably clean Nike‚Ñ¢ sneakers of the investing queen. She glanced around the room, locking eyes with me.\n\n‚ÄúAre you \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*?‚Äù she asked with a sultry, yet modulated tone that made me feel like I was sinking into a bed of the softest, sweetest marshmallows in the world.\n\n‚ÄúY-yes, I am‚Äù I said, struggling to overcome the intense feeling I was committing some heinous crime by speaking to such a regal woman. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come for the investor conference you invited me to, Ms. Woods.‚Äù\n\nShe smiled with such genuine happiness that it felt like my heart would leap out of my chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been expecting you‚Äù she said breathily. ‚ÄúPlease follow me.‚Äù\n\nCathie proceeded to give me a tour of the ARK Investing offices, showing off the various stations that ARK employees were busily working out. I saw Bloomberg terminals everywhere filled with charts and symbols, some of which I recognized and some that I didn‚Äôt. As we travelled around the office, Cathie explained Ark‚Äôs investing strategy with energy and passion that was infectious. Every movement that she made as she breathlessly spoke about identifying innovative companies that could positively disrupt the current economy emphasized her slender form. I felt a rising sense of excitement inside of in me for when the conference began and I could explore every nook and cranny of Cathie‚Äôs current asset allocation for ARKK, though I was disappointed that I would have to share such a personal moment with others. Finally, the tour came to an end, and she guided me to the conference room as smoothly as she guided her wise investments.\n\nThe room itself was fairly innocuous, with a view of a nearby building lot that had been turned into a small park, a large table, and a projector showing the first slide of a presentation labeled ‚ÄúStrategic Investment Goals for ARKK in the First Quarter of 2021.‚Äù As I took it in, I heard the click of a door locking and turned around. Cathie stood in front of the door, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes framed perfectly by her charming glasses.\n\n‚ÄúMs. Woods,‚Äù I began, slightly confused but equally excited.\n\n‚ÄúCathie, please,‚Äù she said, still smiling. Blushing a little, I began again.\n\n‚ÄúC-Cathie, what about the other people who are supposed to be here? They can‚Äôt get in anymore.‚Äù\n\nShe laughed, her voice like water over the clearest crystals. ‚ÄúWhat others? There are no others. It‚Äôs only you and me today.‚Äù She began to move towards me.\n\n‚ÄúOh really? I feel really happy, but did you need to lock the door? Surely you need to be available in case someone needs to ask for your feelings about, I don‚Äôt know, an up-and-coming pet store that uses blockchain technology to track animal health?‚Äù\n\nShe laughed again. ‚ÄúThey know my feelings about that sort of thing,‚Äù she whispered, her seductive voice caressing my ears ‚ÄúBut right now, I‚Äôm more concerned about what you‚Äôre feeling.‚Äù She was in front of me now, light green eyes penetrating mine.\n\n‚ÄúI feel excited‚Äù I said, trying to calm my rising desire ‚Äúto hear about ARK‚Äôs investment goals for the upcoming quarter.‚Äù\n\nHer soft, perfectly manicured hand caressed my thigh, tracing a slow path up my leg towards my belt. ‚ÄúIs that all you‚Äôre feeling excited about‚Äù she asked, glancing at the rapidly bulging area of my jeans ‚Äúor is there something else?‚Äù\n\nI swallowed nervously, trying to control my nearly unstoppable urge to grab her hand and move it directly over the engorged center of my lust. ‚ÄúI-I guess that I‚Äôm particularly excited to hear whether you‚Äôre going to be buying some IPOB and QS soon.‚Äù\n\nHer hand had reached the buckle now. ‚ÄúOh? Well,‚Äù she said softly ‚Äúwhile I can‚Äôt divulge the exact equities ARK will be buying for a little while, I can tell you that your sentiments are quite‚Äù She leaned in, her breath caressing my ear ‚Äúsimilar to mine.‚Äù\n\nThere could be no more restraining my overwhelming passion. I dropped to my knees and began frantically kissing the tips of her sneakers, so grateful for the opportunity to express my undying devotion to the woman who had mercifully created a multimillion-dollar company to spread her love and investing experience to unworthy ones such as herself. \n\n‚ÄúPlease raise your head, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.‚Äù She said, laughing a little. My senses returned, I frantically scrambled to my feet.\n\n‚ÄúMs. Woods I am so sorry‚Äù I began, brightly blushing at my lack of control and cursing myself for disgracing myself and my idol in such a way. Still laughing, she sat on the table and, crossing her legs, began to unlace her sneakers. As I stood there in utter shock, she dropped them to the floor and peeled off her socks. Proffering her right foot, she wiggled her toes in a teasing way.\n\n‚ÄúCome now, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, wouldn‚Äôt you rather do it like this?‚Äù she asked, gazing at me with those adorable brown eyes.\n\nI once again dropped to my knees in sublime peace that not only had my idol forgiven me, but had granted me an even greater honor by allowing my unworthy lips to touch her bare feet. Trembling, I brought my lips frantically to bear on her foot and showered them with the purest expression of gratitude I could possibly hope to give. Top, toes, ankle and sole; all received my heartfelt feelings. Cathie arched back her head and began to moan, which only fueled my desperate desire to continue to please her.\n\nMy dick was a steel rod, and I only wanted to temper it inside of the woman who would guide me to a wonderful new world of consistently outperforming the market by double digits and perpetual green. With Cathie in charge, there was no way that I would end up having to wage slave until I was well past the Social Security cutoff. I stood up, grabbed her shoulders and pushed her down on the table. My lust could no longer be contained.\n\n‚ÄúOh my‚Äù Cathie giggled ‚Äúit seems like you‚Äôre really raring to get in on more of ARK‚Äôs offerings. By all means, please explore what I have to offer.‚Äù\n\nI was beyond words at this point. As she slid off her slim pants and exposed herself, I practically tore my own off in my haste to simultaneously express my overwhelming gratitude and to further sample all that Cathie and ARK had to offer me. I was briefly concerned; would Cathie be disappointed in my size? But as I dropped my jeans to the floor, she gazed at it with a lusty expression.\n\n‚ÄúYou know‚Äù she said, reaching out to guide it towards her ‚Äúneither a company nor a portfolio needs to be big in order to be a surprise.‚Äù \n\nMy doubts vanished and, consumed by my feelings of gratitude and lust, I plunged straight into her. Immediately I was consumed with the ecstasy of sealing the deal on a bright green future, a pleasure so immense that I let out a cry of pure pleasure. Cathie smiled, her glasses knocked slightly askew by the ferociousness of my thrust, and wrapped her legs around me. Locked by the embrace of her legs I could do nothing else but start thrusting again and again, reliving that ecstasy over and over again with every motion.\n\nTime ceased to exist in any standard form; there was only the grunts and cries of pleasure as our bodies entwined in a primal dance of pleasure and mutual appreciation for what each of us brought to the table; her, the wisdom and record of delivering such stellar results and me, with my devotion to following her. At last, the feelings inside of me came to a massive climax.\n\n‚ÄúCathie, I-I‚Ä¶‚Äù I gasped in between my thrusts.\n\n‚ÄúYes, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*?‚Äù She asked, panting with anticipation.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt contain myself any longer. Practically screaming in anticipation, I yelled ‚ÄúCathie, I want to dump all of my retirement holdings into ARKK. Your record is impeccable, and the returns are just too good to ignore. I‚Äôm gonna do it, I‚Äôm gonna dump it all in your fund!‚Äù\n\nSmiling as mischievously as ever, she released prison of her legs right as I mustered the strength for my final push, causing me to pull out of her. I shuddered in ecstasy and a hint of disappointment as my pent-up feelings exploded out over her, before I ungracefully fell to the floor. Above me I could hear her giggling and, craning my head up to her, I saw that she had sat up and had taken off her glasses.\n\n‚ÄúIt makes me so happy,‚Äù she said, cleaning them on her sweater ‚Äúthat you feel so passionately about ARK and our investment strategy. However,‚Äù and here she put her glasses back on and shot me a kind glance ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt wise to be so over-invested in one particular asset. Even with ARKK, our largest holding for this past month only comprised 10% of the fund‚Äôs total value. You shouldn‚Äôt become so attached to one particular investment or else you expose yourself to too much risk.‚Äù\n\nI began to sob with happiness. Even though I had put my all into that confession, Cathie rejected me, but still accepted and cherished my feelings. She was only trying to look out for my financial wellbeing. Such angelic compassion! Truly, I and everyone else invested in ARKK were undeserving of her wisdom and generosity.\n\nLeaving ARK Investing that evening, after spending many more hours intimately discussing Cathie‚Äôs investment strategies, it was hard not to be content. Even now it still feels so unreal that I was able to receive such impressive and deep guidance from a professional of her stature. Upon my arrival back home, I had my ticket stubs from that wonderous trip framed, just so that whenever I fell into doubt with my crippling options and investment addiction, I could glance over at them and feel assured that my idol was watching over me from the seventh-floor suite where I had received such passionate and thorough advising. Truly, it was an investor conference to remember.", 158, '/r/smallstreetbets/comments/kfs5a3/an_investors_conference_with_cathie_woods_too/'])

Proffering her right foot, she wiggled her toes in a teasing way.\n\n‚ÄúCome now, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, wouldn‚Äôt you rather do it like this?‚Äù she asked, gazing at me with those adorable brown eyes.\n\nI once again dropped to my knees in sublime peace that not only had my idol forgiven me, but had granted me an even greater honor by allowing my unworthy lips to touch her bare feet. Trembling, I brought my lips frantically to bear on her foot and showered them with the purest expression of gratitude I could possibly hope to give. Top, toes, ankle and sole; all received my heartfelt feelings. Cathie arched back her head and began to moan, which only fueled my desperate desire to continue to please her.\n\nMy dick was a steel rod, and I only wanted to temper it inside of the woman who would guide me to a wonderful new world of consistently outperforming the market by double digits and perpetual green. With Cathie in charge, there was no way that I would end up having to wage slave until I was well past the Social Security cutoff. I stood up, grabbed her shoulders and pushed her down on the table. My lust could no longer be contained.\n\n‚ÄúOh my‚Äù Cathie giggled ‚Äúit seems like you‚Äôre really raring to get in on more of ARK‚Äôs offerings. By all means, please explore what I have to offer.‚Äù\n\nI was beyond words at this point. As she slid off her slim pants and exposed herself, I practically tore my own off in my haste to simultaneously express my overwhelming gratitude and to further sample all that Cathie and ARK had to offer me. I was briefly concerned; would Cathie be disappointed in my size? But as I dropped my jeans to the floor, she gazed at it with a lusty expression.\n\n‚ÄúYou know‚Äù she said, reaching out to guide it towards her ‚Äúneither a company nor a portfolio needs to be big in order to be a surprise.‚Äù \n\nMy doubts vanished and, consumed by my feelings of gratitude and lust, I plunged straight into her. Immediately I was consumed with the ecstasy of sealing the deal on a bright green future, a pleasure so immense that I let out a cry of pure pleasure. Cathie smiled, her glasses knocked slightly askew by the ferociousness of my thrust, and wrapped her legs around me. Locked by the embrace of her legs I could do nothing else but start thrusting again and again, reliving that ecstasy over and over again with every motion.\n\nTime ceased to exist in any standard form; there was only the grunts and cries of pleasure as our bodies entwined in a primal dance of pleasure and mutual appreciation for what each of us brought to the table; her, the wisdom and record of delivering such stellar results and me, with my devotion to following her. At last, the feelings inside of me came to a massive climax.\n\n‚ÄúCathie, I-I‚Ä¶‚Äù I gasped in between my thrusts.\n\n‚ÄúYes, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*?‚Äù She asked, panting with anticipation.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt contain myself any longer.

I‚Äôm gonna do it, I‚Äôm gonna dump it all in your fund!‚Äù\n\nSmiling as mischievously as ever, she released prison of her legs right as I mustered the strength for my final push, causing me to pull out of her. I shuddered in ecstasy and a hint of disappointment as my pent-up feelings exploded out over her, before I ungracefully fell to the floor. Above me I could hear her giggling and, craning my head up to her, I saw that she had sat up and had taken off her glasses.\n\n‚ÄúIt makes me so happy,‚Äù she said, cleaning them on her sweater ‚Äúthat you feel so passionately about ARK and our investment strategy. However,‚Äù and here she put her glasses back on and shot me a kind glance ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt wise to be so over-invested in one particular asset. Even with ARKK, our largest holding for this past month only comprised 10% of the fund‚Äôs total value. You shouldn‚Äôt become so attached to one particular investment or else you expose yourself to too much risk.‚Äù\n\nI began to sob with happiness. Even though I had put my all into that confession, Cathie rejected me, but still accepted and cherished my feelings. She was only trying to look out for my financial wellbeing.

QS     m=     3, s=   160 (post: An Investor's Conference with Cathie Woods (Too Spicy for WSB), comment: ["An Investor's Conference with Cathie Woods (Too Spicy for WSB)  The December air was cold as I emerged from the Broadway & 28th subway station onto the streets of New York. Double checking the directions, I nervously began to walk down East 28th street to my destination. There was a good reason for my anxiousness. For you see, today was an incredibly special day for me; I was to visit the headquarters of one of the best actively-managed ETFs in the United States, ARK Invest. Their focus on disruptive, cutting-edge innovation investment had captivated me six months ago when, hungry for exposure to the hot action in emerging industries, I noticed their inordinately large exposure to TSLA and many other companies. The fact that they also had a trailing return that was over double a traditional boomer benchmark was also incredibly arousing. \n\nExcited by the dual prospect of exposure to up-and-coming companies and busty returns, I decided to buy into ARKK, and now sat at a princely 60% return-on-investment since entering. I was filled with hot feelings of gratitude, and owed it all to the wisdom of one special woman; Cathie Woods, founder and CEO of ARK Invest. Overcome with these feelings, I tweeted a picture of my portfolio value to her and a message of thanks for her forward-looking investments and a wish for continued success. \n\nTo my shock, she sent me a direct message thanking me for my feelings and congratulating me on my success. ‚ÄúIt makes me happy that it isn‚Äôt just those big, stuffy hedge funds that are buying ARKK. / Even small portfolios can benefit from our unique approach to investing.‚Äù Our conversation continued along those lines, until once again Cathie delivered another massive shock; ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about having a press release with retail investors, to show off investors like you as examples of the micro success of our strategies. / Would you be interested in coming to our office for the ARKK experience?‚Äù How could I turn down an invitation from my personal idol? I sold some of the SPY shares I was holding, since they were barely doing anything, and booked a ticket to JFK at once.\n\nAnd now here I was, standing in front of the offices of the woman who would make my wildest investment fantasies come true. I braced myself and entered the fairly unassuming building. With no elevator, I was forced to climb seven flights of stairs and with each flight, my anxiety only grew. Was this all some sort of sick joke by an intern running Cathie‚Äôs Twitter account? Would I arrive and be laughed at for being the dude who had to bandwagon off smarter people because I couldn‚Äôt do my own investing? By the time I reached the top of the stairs, my tension was at its peak. I hesitated before the door, but decided that after all, you only live once. If I was being jerked around, I would take my jerking like a man.\n\nEntering the reception room, the young man sitting at the reception desk glanced up at me with a bored look. ‚ÄúGood morning, what can I do for you today?‚Äù Feeling slightly embarrassed, I told him that I was here for the micro investors conference organized by Cathie Woods. As I said that, his expression shifted and he straightened up. ‚ÄúBy any chance, are you Mr. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*?‚Äù I said that I was. ‚ÄúPlease have a seat, Ms. Woods has been anxiously awaiting your arrival.‚Äù Taking a seat, I decided to kill some time calling people in my favorite options gambling server stupid for not understanding the fundamental rule of buying low and selling high. While doing so, I noticed that the receptionist was stealing inquisitive glances at me over the desk, and even calling people retarded ended up being unable to assuage my worries.\n\nJust as I considered getting up and leaving, she appeared. Sporting a subdued gray wool sweater and black pants, Cathie strode into the reception room. Tossing her cropped auburn hair, glasses glinting, she was as magnificent in person as her pictures suggested. Everything about her posture, stride and aura confirmed my intense feelings of devotion for her revolutionary focus on technologically enabled disruption across all economic sectors. Though she was 64, she had the same energy as a woman a third of her age. Only the iron will that I had cultivated diamond handing SPAC plays kept me from kneeling and kissing the impeccably clean Nike‚Ñ¢ sneakers of the investing queen. She glanced around the room, locking eyes with me.\n\n‚ÄúAre you \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*?‚Äù she asked with a sultry, yet modulated tone that made me feel like I was sinking into a bed of the softest, sweetest marshmallows in the world.\n\n‚ÄúY-yes, I am‚Äù I said, struggling to overcome the intense feeling I was committing some heinous crime by speaking to such a regal woman. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come for the investor conference you invited me to, Ms. Woods.‚Äù\n\nShe smiled with such genuine happiness that it felt like my heart would leap out of my chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been expecting you‚Äù she said breathily. ‚ÄúPlease follow me.‚Äù\n\nCathie proceeded to give me a tour of the ARK Investing offices, showing off the various stations that ARK employees were busily working out. I saw Bloomberg terminals everywhere filled with charts and symbols, some of which I recognized and some that I didn‚Äôt. As we travelled around the office, Cathie explained Ark‚Äôs investing strategy with energy and passion that was infectious. Every movement that she made as she breathlessly spoke about identifying innovative companies that could positively disrupt the current economy emphasized her slender form. I felt a rising sense of excitement inside of in me for when the conference began and I could explore every nook and cranny of Cathie‚Äôs current asset allocation for ARKK, though I was disappointed that I would have to share such a personal moment with others. Finally, the tour came to an end, and she guided me to the conference room as smoothly as she guided her wise investments.\n\nThe room itself was fairly innocuous, with a view of a nearby building lot that had been turned into a small park, a large table, and a projector showing the first slide of a presentation labeled ‚ÄúStrategic Investment Goals for ARKK in the First Quarter of 2021.‚Äù As I took it in, I heard the click of a door locking and turned around. Cathie stood in front of the door, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes framed perfectly by her charming glasses.\n\n‚ÄúMs. Woods,‚Äù I began, slightly confused but equally excited.\n\n‚ÄúCathie, please,‚Äù she said, still smiling. Blushing a little, I began again.\n\n‚ÄúC-Cathie, what about the other people who are supposed to be here? They can‚Äôt get in anymore.‚Äù\n\nShe laughed, her voice like water over the clearest crystals. ‚ÄúWhat others? There are no others. It‚Äôs only you and me today.‚Äù She began to move towards me.\n\n‚ÄúOh really? I feel really happy, but did you need to lock the door? Surely you need to be available in case someone needs to ask for your feelings about, I don‚Äôt know, an up-and-coming pet store that uses blockchain technology to track animal health?‚Äù\n\nShe laughed again. ‚ÄúThey know my feelings about that sort of thing,‚Äù she whispered, her seductive voice caressing my ears ‚ÄúBut right now, I‚Äôm more concerned about what you‚Äôre feeling.‚Äù She was in front of me now, light green eyes penetrating mine.\n\n‚ÄúI feel excited‚Äù I said, trying to calm my rising desire ‚Äúto hear about ARK‚Äôs investment goals for the upcoming quarter.‚Äù\n\nHer soft, perfectly manicured hand caressed my thigh, tracing a slow path up my leg towards my belt. ‚ÄúIs that all you‚Äôre feeling excited about‚Äù she asked, glancing at the rapidly bulging area of my jeans ‚Äúor is there something else?‚Äù\n\nI swallowed nervously, trying to control my nearly unstoppable urge to grab her hand and move it directly over the engorged center of my lust. ‚ÄúI-I guess that I‚Äôm particularly excited to hear whether you‚Äôre going to be buying some IPOB and QS soon.‚Äù\n\nHer hand had reached the buckle now. ‚ÄúOh? Well,‚Äù she said softly ‚Äúwhile I can‚Äôt divulge the exact equities ARK will be buying for a little while, I can tell you that your sentiments are quite‚Äù She leaned in, her breath caressing my ear ‚Äúsimilar to mine.‚Äù\n\nThere could be no more restraining my overwhelming passion. I dropped to my knees and began frantically kissing the tips of her sneakers, so grateful for the opportunity to express my undying devotion to the woman who had mercifully created a multimillion-dollar company to spread her love and investing experience to unworthy ones such as herself. \n\n‚ÄúPlease raise your head, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.‚Äù She said, laughing a little. My senses returned, I frantically scrambled to my feet.\n\n‚ÄúMs. Woods I am so sorry‚Äù I began, brightly blushing at my lack of control and cursing myself for disgracing myself and my idol in such a way. Still laughing, she sat on the table and, crossing her legs, began to unlace her sneakers. As I stood there in utter shock, she dropped them to the floor and peeled off her socks.

Here we have a company that is building these power plants that run off natural gas, which is 50-60% cleaner burning than coal. The tech is already there. There will be a lot of incentive in the next few years to get rid of coal power plants and replace them with these ultra efficient cleaner burning natural gas power plants. \n\nEdit: They also build solar power plants, and wind plants, so this is a great green energy play both short and long term. Also it hasn't run up a crazy amount so far this year like many other green energy stocks.\n\nRead for yourself: [Gemma power systems, a subsidiary of AGX](https://www.gemmapower.com)", 16, '/r/smallstreetbets/comments/kgeve8/clean_energy_2021/ggeacmu/'])

And despite people (investing and stocks) constantly saying they will crash, they have continued to grow at parabolic rates to the point where my % of return is incredible for one year. So I would recommend holding some QCLN if you have no exposure to Tesla and Nio. \n\nI always recommend TAN as my favorite green energy stock. The technology advancements in solar have consistently outpaced wind, hydro, etc. Those advancements eventually make it to solar manufactures. There is not a clear winner in solar, and the market is global so I love TAN as my top holding. (expect for $GIK in my gambling account.)\n\nBased on the faster technology changes in solar, I have weighted TAN heavier than both ICLN and QCLN. ICLN is actually my least favorite green energy etf.

For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment.

A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year.

As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US.

China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year.

That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021.

Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016.

That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US.

China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year.

That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 21st, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 ‚Äî a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.\n*****\n> Even with this year‚Äôs sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n> Those in CNBC‚Äôs survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It‚Äôs nothing like what you saw in the spring,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.‚Äù\n*****\n> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n> # The week ahead\n> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla‚Äôs entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see whether or not there‚Äôs selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it‚Äôs absorbed within the S&P,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. ‚ÄúAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n> # First-quarter speed bump\n> ‚ÄúThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there‚Äôs the potential for some negative outlooks. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.‚Äù Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n> Fundstrat‚Äôs Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he‚Äôs looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it‚Äôs more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,‚Äù said Krosby.\n*****\n> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don‚Äôt like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Bank of America‚Äôs Harris.\n*****\n> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it‚Äôs hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,‚Äù said Arone.\n*****\n> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don‚Äôt have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n> In the CNBC/Moody‚Äôs Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that‚Äôs open, that‚Äôs a big boost,‚Äù Harris said.\n*****\n> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don‚Äôt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # An Overbought World\n\n> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n> Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> The ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch‚Äôs now famous line states, ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, October‚Äôs report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October‚Äôs report.\n\n> Breadth in this month‚Äôs report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don‚Äôt hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online‚Äì all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Chart of the Year\n\n> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. ‚ÄúOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don‚Äôt bet against several more years of new highs.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We‚Äôve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here‚Äôs the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 18th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G5gWArIv8Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.20.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7u7YUeg-Q))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$NVCE** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$CVGW** \n> * **$YCBD** \n> * **$LESL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

Today is an opportunity with big upsides. \n\nThe spac HCAC is gonna merge with Canoo an ev company that is releasing a line of new EV cars today that look straight out of west world. \n\n "3 different sizes (in video at least‚Ä¶\xa0only 2 on website) ,TONS of configurations.  In one of the videos, they are teasing 2 covered vehicles, which looks  like a lifestyle but in the form of a pickup truck, and a more  normal-shaped sedan. These have been seen in their investor  presentations, but they\'re likely teasing more upcoming announcements!a $33,000 price point and no subscription fee".\n\n Their merger date is Monday, December 21, 2020 and yesterday the company was valued at $30 a share. But this morning, likely due to the morning dip it caused a chain reaction of stop losses that drilled the price to $18. \n\nOptions, warrants, and stock went down a shit town. I bought the dip hard and am already up. \n\nGet while the getting is good. \n\nHere are the relevant links:\n\nSEC Filing:\n\n [https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-043195/](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-043195/) \n\n$30 price target link:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roth-initiates-coverage-canoo-30-171546436.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roth-initiates-coverage-canoo-30-171546436.html)\n\nPress release info for new cars:\n\n[https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv)\n\nPromo video of cars:\n\n[https://www.canoo.com/canoo/](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/)\n\n[https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/)', 28, '/r/smallstreetbets/comments/kf2zll/dd_god_damn_best_sale_of_the_day_hcac_spac_is/'])
CBOE   m=     2, s=    16 (post: SPY Covered Calls. The Triple Income Strategy?, comment: ["I belive that there are CBOE indexes based on the strategy of selling covered calls on the S&P 500. In particular, one sells 2% OTM calls, and it underperforms a lot compared to the actual S&P 500 index. So your strategy is a bad idea comparing to just buying and holding SPY. And I'll also tell you why: the premium is not that big (because IV is low) and you miss out on the important days (that happen a couple times per year) when the index shoots up by a lot. But the losses you take are the same as the index; in fact, that same CBOE index still has not  fully recovered from march because of the covered calls limiting the upside. So in conclusion, wheeling ETFs rarely works because IV is low. The only time wheeling works is with high IV stocks. Wheeling is not a holy grail to make more money with the same risk. You actually need to find good stocks that can be wheeled. Stocks that you are actually bullish on that are very volatile.", 8, '/r/smallstreetbets/comments/kfow1o/spy_covered_calls_the_triple_income_strategy/gg9xdig/'])

The Triple Income Strategy?, comment: ['Maybe seeing the numbers will help you understand: \n\nBuy 100 shares @ 300 each = 30,000\nSell call 5% OTM 1 month DTE for $200. \n\nAfter one month...\n\nSPY drops 15% to $255. The call you sold expired worthless. \n\nSo now you have $25,550 + $200.  If you try to sell a call 5% above the price you bought in at, you will maybe get a couple dollars because it‚Äôs now SO far OTM. So instead, you sell a call 5% OTM from the current price of 255. (Let‚Äôs just say you sold a call at 265 to simply rounding). So you sell the call at $265 for $200. \n\nOne month later SPY moves back to $300. You are going to be forced to sell your shares for $265 each. \n\n$26,500 + $200 + $200 = $26,900. You lose $3,100 based on your initial $30,000 investment. \n\nI agree covered calls are pretty safe, but this kind of stuff can still happen. The other shitty aspect is if it moons and then when your option expires, you may have to buy it for way above your strike. Again, you‚Äôre losing money relative to just holding SPY.\n\nPeople have done backtests against SPY before and selling calls against your shares doesn‚Äôt outperform.', 7, '/r/smallstreetbets/comments/kfow1o/spy_covered_calls_the_triple_income_strategy/ggadkjl/'])

BIG    m=     1, s=     3 (post: A long term bet on Black Gold, comment: ["A long term bet on Black GoldApparently the glue eating mods over at WSB don't like oil stonks, so I figured I'd post it here. So boys, girls, and gamblers, lets talk about some good old fashion black gold. I understand that some people have been burned on oil, however I'd like to make the bull case for its future profitability. Take it with a grain of salt, because the bears are right in the sense that oil is always a gamble, and can turn sour based on the mood swings of a Saudi price or Russian Dictator. Nonetheless, I have about 40% of my small ass portfolio on it, and here are the reasons why. So kids, buckle down, take your Adderall, and lets speculate a thing or two.\n\n1. Oil demand will recover. Yes, currently its big time down, and will be for a while, but eventually demand will return to normal. This not not an unfounded statement of an opinion, many banks including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America see a total recovery by the end of 2021 as well subsequent increase in prices. This is further endorsed by the International Energy Agency and OPEC, who see a fully recovery by at latest middle of 2022. Yes, the world is transitioning to the usage of more renewables, but that process is going to take time. The world isn't going to wake up one day and be 100% renewables, just like you aren't going to sell your gas vehicle to buy an inconvenient shiny electric vehicle. The world still needs oil for the next couple of years, so why not make a couple bucks along the way?\n2. Now that we've discussed demand, lets talk about supply, or whats left of it. Global rig count is down, bigly. Here is the global rig count for the past 5 years ([https://ycharts.com/indicators/total\\_world\\_rotary\\_rigs](https://ycharts.com/indicators/total_world_rotary_rigs)). Notice its in the gutter. O&G companies are cutting their supply down BIG, and the problem is, once its gone, its extremely expensive and time consuming to get back. Demand is fickle, and like that arrogant rich kid who wants everything now, the world will go from not wanting any oil to wanting all of the oil. Supply is slow to match demand, and with rigs taking time and money to get back into operation, oil companies will be reluctant to provide as they've been burnt one to many times. This is entirely speculative, but there is a non-zero chance of a small shortage occurring, causing prices to skyrocket for a short period of time. Aka your calls will print.\n3. Market Consolidation. Ever since the start of the plague, oil and gas companies have either been dropping like flies or have been bought out by bigger dogs. Even the big dogs are buying out other big dogs, a couple good examples being Canadian based Cenovus buying Husky for 3.8billion, ConocoPhillips buying Concho Resources for 9.7billion, or Devon Energy buying WPX for 2.6billion. If demand stays the same, but the market is a little closer to a monopoly and consolidated, a higher price can be demanded for oil.\n4. And finally, even if you don't believe a single fucking thing I said above, look at who is investing. Michael Burry has 15% of his portfolio on precision drilling (66million), Carl Ichan has 887 million in OXY, and Warren Buffet increased his holdings of Suncor by 30% back in Q2. Institutional holdings of oil and gas companies are all the same if not higher across the board. I might be autistic, but these big boys are not, and they are placing their bets.\n\nPositions:\n\nMy positions: Shares on Cenovus, Suncor, Exxon, Imperial, Secure Energy Services, Ensign Drilling, and Precision Drilling. 2022 LEAPS on Cenovus, Suncor, and Precision.\n\nTake your pick though, shares or 2022/2023 LEAPs on any LARGE oil major (XOM, OXY, BP, CVE, SU, IMO, RDS)\n\nI also wrote this post as a discussion because I'd like to give the bears a chance to come out from hibernation and explain to me why this might be a stupid fucking idea. So have at it you filthy animals, tell me why oil will be dead along with my portfolio by 2022.

IMO    m=     1, s=     3 (post: A long term bet on Black Gold, comment: ["A long term bet on Black GoldApparently the glue eating mods over at WSB don't like oil stonks, so I figured I'd post it here. So boys, girls, and gamblers, lets talk about some good old fashion black gold. I understand that some people have been burned on oil, however I'd like to make the bull case for its future profitability. Take it with a grain of salt, because the bears are right in the sense that oil is always a gamble, and can turn sour based on the mood swings of a Saudi price or Russian Dictator. Nonetheless, I have about 40% of my small ass portfolio on it, and here are the reasons why. So kids, buckle down, take your Adderall, and lets speculate a thing or two.\n\n1. Oil demand will recover. Yes, currently its big time down, and will be for a while, but eventually demand will return to normal. This not not an unfounded statement of an opinion, many banks including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America see a total recovery by the end of 2021 as well subsequent increase in prices. This is further endorsed by the International Energy Agency and OPEC, who see a fully recovery by at latest middle of 2022. Yes, the world is transitioning to the usage of more renewables, but that process is going to take time. The world isn't going to wake up one day and be 100% renewables, just like you aren't going to sell your gas vehicle to buy an inconvenient shiny electric vehicle. The world still needs oil for the next couple of years, so why not make a couple bucks along the way?\n2. Now that we've discussed demand, lets talk about supply, or whats left of it. Global rig count is down, bigly. Here is the global rig count for the past 5 years ([https://ycharts.com/indicators/total\\_world\\_rotary\\_rigs](https://ycharts.com/indicators/total_world_rotary_rigs)). Notice its in the gutter. O&G companies are cutting their supply down BIG, and the problem is, once its gone, its extremely expensive and time consuming to get back. Demand is fickle, and like that arrogant rich kid who wants everything now, the world will go from not wanting any oil to wanting all of the oil. Supply is slow to match demand, and with rigs taking time and money to get back into operation, oil companies will be reluctant to provide as they've been burnt one to many times. This is entirely speculative, but there is a non-zero chance of a small shortage occurring, causing prices to skyrocket for a short period of time. Aka your calls will print.\n3. Market Consolidation. Ever since the start of the plague, oil and gas companies have either been dropping like flies or have been bought out by bigger dogs. Even the big dogs are buying out other big dogs, a couple good examples being Canadian based Cenovus buying Husky for 3.8billion, ConocoPhillips buying Concho Resources for 9.7billion, or Devon Energy buying WPX for 2.6billion. If demand stays the same, but the market is a little closer to a monopoly and consolidated, a higher price can be demanded for oil.\n4. And finally, even if you don't believe a single fucking thing I said above, look at who is investing. Michael Burry has 15% of his portfolio on precision drilling (66million), Carl Ichan has 887 million in OXY, and Warren Buffet increased his holdings of Suncor by 30% back in Q2. Institutional holdings of oil and gas companies are all the same if not higher across the board. I might be autistic, but these big boys are not, and they are placing their bets.\n\nPositions:\n\nMy positions: Shares on Cenovus, Suncor, Exxon, Imperial, Secure Energy Services, Ensign Drilling, and Precision Drilling. 2022 LEAPS on Cenovus, Suncor, and Precision.\n\nTake your pick though, shares or 2022/2023 LEAPs on any LARGE oil major (XOM, OXY, BP, CVE, SU, IMO, RDS)\n\nI also wrote this post as a discussion because I'd like to give the bears a chance to come out from hibernation and explain to me why this might be a stupid fucking idea.

I stopped using robinhood like 9months ago because their extended trading hours suck butt (switched to TDA and webull, TDA for OTCs that webull doesn\'t trade and webull for the stupid early premarket trading- 430am est which is 4.5hours before robinhooders can even touch the market)\n\nAnyway, I don\'t see anything about banning retail investors. You realize retail investors are like 10% of the market? You realize most retail investors lose money? You think the SEC or anyone cares about booger picking Billy making 50k? Cause there are many people behind Billy that just lost their money. I doubt anyone cares, just get off robinhood if you\'re so worried about it. I doubt anyone wants to ban us guppies in the ocean... it\'s like when they banned candy flavor blunt wraps to "protect" kids from being lured in. The complaint seems to say robinhood kinda lures kids in when they have no idea what theyre doing....\n\nEdit: u/finnchurchill', 5, '/r/smallstreetbets/comments/kgfyg5/wall_street_bets_sucks/ggejdx9/'])
