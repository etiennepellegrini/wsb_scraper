I rely on TD Ameritrade for all of my stock trading and a lot of my news. I also research companies on yahoo finance. \n\nI don't have all the right answers, but a really good way to get going is to find a trading platform like TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, or many others to get started. \n\nSome platforms cost to use, others don't. Some are easy and others are hard.. They all have their pros and cons. \n\nOnce you decide on your platform, use it and get to know it heavily, and put a little cash in. It really doesn't matter how much because every little bit is buying in to you. My general idea is to keep it funded though. I knew i wouldn't miss 20 at first, so I put in 20 every pay period. \n\nReally research companies. Look at their cash on hand, look at their charts and how old the company is, read recent news about the company (found on Yahoo Finance or your trading platform) and get to know the ownership of the company. \n\nI was told to only buy stocks I'd be willing to hold on to for 10 years which I think is good general advice. But I also stuck some short sellers in there to make some quick cash and help me buy something better. For instance, I traded my Novavax gains for Apple stock which is now a long term hold for me. It won't always work that way, but I felt it was safe.\n\nDiversify your portfolio. \n\nLastly, but most importantly (in my opinion) no emotions in trading and STICK WITH WHAT YOU KNOW!\n\nDon't have a favorite stock.  \n\nDon't be afraid/sad to let your stock go. \n\nIf you buy into what you know, you're more keen and up to date on news and may have a better idea on where the company is heading. \n\nI work in tech so most of my portfolio is tech stocks. I'm also really interested in real estate so I have a lot of real estate stocks. I don't know anything about cannabis and those happen to be my worst stocks lmao! \n\nIf you have questions, this community is really cool.

The real mistake about this is that most people only remember those "real winners". But what about all the losers? What about all the losers you sold early enough?

REAL   m=     2, s=     9 (post: My 8 investing guidelines., comment: ['I have to disagree on some points and want give some food for thought. \n\nFirst of all you missed a mistake which you actually made in your first sentences. You said you sold winners and it was a mistake. It wasn\'t. The real mistake about that is to think it was a mistake to sell the winners. Well, you can easily say that 5 years later. But WHO told you 5 years back THAT they\'re going to be the winners? Nobody. You can\'t catch every bottom and every high, it\'s impossible. The real mistake about this is that most people only remember those "real winners". But what about all the losers? What about all the losers you sold early enough? Well, they didn\'t grow those 2000% in the last years but didn\'t burn your capital either. The thing is that everybody forgets about the losers. Why don\'t you look back on the losers your sold? What if some of them went to zero? This will make you feel like you did something right instead. There are enough losing stocks out there, but as I said before, everybody just looks at the few extraordinary stocks. And thats the mistake. Only A FEW will behave like that and way more won\'t.\n\n Also, you weren\'t able to tell 5 years ago that those companies will be still successful now. That\'s only possible right now after you saw them continue being succesful. It\'s a HUGE mistake alot of people in different businesses make.   In the end, everybody is a wise person and able to tell the truth, BUT the only thing that matters is NOW.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> **3. When the overall market is down, you buy** \n\nEverybody can have an own opinion but I have to say that this is wrong. You first say that no one can predict the market, so how do I know when to buy? What if I buy too early and not only my stock, but everything is still going downwards afterwards? Trying to time the market is excactly what you\'re trying to do at that point.\n\nAlso, you can\'t say that when the overall market is down, every stock is on sale. In every crash there were stocks that weren\'t able to recover and sometimes even whole sectors that took 10-20 years to recover. \n\nIt\'s the worst time to buy when the overall market is down. You don\'t know what will happen next. You don\'t know which sectors or stocks are going to drop further. You don\'t know which stocks are profiting the best afterwards. You don\'t know if the overall market will need 1, 5 or 10 years to recover. Theres always a reason why markets crash. And do you really fight it by thinking that all the stocks are just on sale now? With the believe that stocks always go up? Well, if you are able to sit there for 5, 10, 20 years until your portfolio comes back to it\'s old strength..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> **4. Don\'t be afraid of corrections.** \n\nThis point is connected to the one above. How do you tell me if it\'s a crash (like in your 3. point), just a correction, or only a selloff? Is 1% a correction? Is 10% a crash? Is 20% a correction? Will it only be a crash with more than 50%?\n\nYou will end up getting slaughtered in a REAL crash when you follow your rules 3 (buying on market lows) and "keep buying" after corrections while "playing the long game". \n\nOn top of that, you simply can\'t say that stocks always go up. That\'s just not true. Maybe if you look at an index,gold or whatever. But it definitely doesn\'t count for stocks. There are so many (back then successful) stocks and companies that went to zero in no matter of time, went bankrupt, took ages to recover, or never came back. And yes, there were people like you and me that were riding it till the end. Until they went bankrupt too. Did they have the believe that everything goes up in the long run? Yes. Did they live for 100 years to be able to see their portfolio recover completely? No.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> **8. Don\'t sell and buy in again to time a correction** \n\nThis point does also not fit to every kind of investor or trader. It\'s totally fine to take profits and get in to the ride again after some time. There are actually people that don\'t want to sit in stocks that move sideways for ages, because they have a better use for the money. I agree with you on the point of not trying to "time a correction" because nobody is able to, but corrections are helpful indicators.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Just keep the money in and stop worrying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really don\'t want to criticize you, because I really like some of your points, but this sentence really is the worst.

Musk himself said his shares are overvalued in march 1st when they were at $90 per share. JPMorgan gave TSLA $90 price target. It happened in 2000, and it will happen again. It might not still be a full bubble that will burst, might take some years or interest rates change, bond yields change and more time and more FOMO. TSLA might go to $500,000 per share, no one gives a fuck until its going up, until it doesn't. Just take their cash flow of the first years they were public, their amount of cars and other products and calculate their annual growth rate. Compare that to the price and ask yourself can this company make 3,600,000 cars alone next year + other products they make? Sounds stupid doesn't it.\n\nThe market goes up and down constantly just check historic S&P composite chart.\n\nDon't forget PFE has a 209B market cap, so its hard for it to move. BNTX is 25B market cap and its much more up this year. Also PFE CEO sold most of his shares and that made so many people sell stock.\n\nNew game changing stocks are good when they are reasonably priced. Looking at ARK ETF holdings. You want to buy good companies at a reasonable price. There are plenty of them still hit by Covid, that will do great when everything is back to normal.\n\nDon't stop doing what you're doing, learn more about fundamental analysis, economics market history.\n\nMarkets aren't always rational and if you are smart and think 10 years ahead, you can make lots of money from there inefficiencies in the market.\n\nThere are explanations from economics and you can say people are betting on future companies, who will lead innovation, so people don't want to miss out especially a Tesla number 2? Like who wouldn't want a 400% return? + there is more people investing than ever before with google searches of investing booming.\n\nIt depends on your risk tolerance and your goals of what you want to achieve?

I think CHWY is a perfect stock that isn’t a meme & isn’t super overvalued on the fundamentals (4.5 P/S) - *but* still offers incredible growth. \n\nI’m buying every dip on CHWY for the next year or two, so bullish on it. Check out BARK - currently trading as STIC until SPAC deal is officially closed. Check out the [Investor Presentation ](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fc915303436806905d7150e/t/5fdae20279e44d2bcf557f77/1608180228067/BARK-Overview-12162020.pdf). Market cap of 1.6B w/ $369M revenue FY2021E (ending in March, so very accurate estimate), so around 4.5 P/S. They have 65% revenue growth YoY, 60% gross margins, 1M+ subscribers, 8.5M+ social media followers, and many more incredible stats. They also are launching more & more product lines (BarkEats - healthy food | BarkBright dog dental solution & wellness platform | both launched in 2020) to increase/grow the TAM. \n\nMight seem weird to own both, but I see it as owning WMT and Target years ago — or something like that, where if one disappeared, the other would obviously do much better, but they both will be growing at amazing rates (as shown already) and because Bark is 1/25 the size and focuses much more specifically on dogs, it can grow super well even if CHWY continues to do well with dogs, too.\n\nAll the tailwinds affecting CHWY — which I assume is why you are bullish on it — also work for Bark, but the lower mkt cap means the chances of 2x, 5x, etc. your $ is higher with Bark if they continue to grow and execute phenomenally well. I.e. CHWY will take a *long time* before it can 5x, for example, and be a 200B+ mkt cap, but I could see BARK growing to 10B mkt cap (over 5x) if it continues to grow / perform this well.', 5, '/r/stocks/comments/kgtgh6/predict_the_best_performing_stock_of_2021_and/ggil3oi/'])

I suppose you think that these managers are seeking the best possible returns? That would be a reasonable assumption, but it’s not true. This is called an alpha strategy and it only accounts for a small percentage of actively managed funds.\n\nA large amount of money in active management is not designed to create alpha. They are designed to provide steady, extremely low risk returns. They use a mix of bonds, ETFs, low beta stocks, etc.\n\nOf course, comparing a 100% equity portfolio to a 60-80% equity portfolio, you’ll find the 100% equity portfolio wins. Especially when the equities the 60-80% funds hold are usually value stocks with little price movement. Essentially, the way to look at this is the investors wanted less risk than VOO or SPY, so of course they have worse returns. Then you have all sorts of other weird funds like short only funds, ESG funds, precious metal funds, etc. \n\nIf you compare high quality alpha funds to the S&P, the S&P gets destroyed. But that’s just part of the story here. Even an alpha fund can’t take on the type of risk that a retail investor can. When you’re managing billions of dollars of other people’s money, your risk tolerance has to be absurdly low.\n\nHonestly, why do you think the hedge fund industry still exists if this were true?

TLRY   m=    21, s=   607 (post: Stock Market News Today | APHA & TLRY Merge | APPLE Rises | Stimulus & FED Meeting Today [12-16], comment: ['Stock Market News Today | APHA & TLRY Merge | APPLE Rises | Stimulus & FED Meeting Today [12-16]**What is the latest news in the stock market? Aphria is merging with Tilray while the stimulus may be agreed on today after the latest developments. Also, the FED starts its 2-day meeting, let’s talk about this and everything happening in the stock market**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we see a great day for the stock market, the best in December actually, as a one-two punch of stimulus and vaccine data helped the rally, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/XkRWtZS) finishing up 1.29%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/dPpXW1X) 1.25% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/smC2WMp) 1.13%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/F07KNd4) dropping more than 7% from the recent highs, as it was nearing the 25 levels which would imply more volatility ahead for the stock market.\n\nWe saw ¾ of the companies gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/PG7tysH) on decent volume, with 145 new highs, as all 11 sectors finished in the green, with Utilities and Energy leading the way up almost 2%, while just 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/1sqbPxT) gained less than 1% for the day, the Communications sector and the consumer staples. This rally was pushed by almost every type of [company](https://ibb.co/5xf4s1b), especially small and mid-caps, as large-caps lagged a bit and were pretty much flat for the day, with the exception of Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TT2xp03), as I said in a previous post, I believe that Apple is ready for takeoff after more and more reports of great numbers in the new iPhone 12 lineup sales, and with the Fitness+ service launching this Monday this keeps increasing the number of services that Apple offers. I believe that the Apple One bundle will be a great revenue stream for them alongside the move to the 5G in the next years.\n\nSo here is the economic [calendar](https://ibb.co/dcbS2NG) for today as we start off early in the morning with MBA mortgage applications, followed but retail sales, PMI, inventories and finish up with the last meeting and decisions from the FED in 2020.\n\nWe also received news that as soon as the FDA & CDC give approval, which could and probably will happen as soon as this weekend, [Moderna](https://ibb.co/B3q3Dkv) will be able to ship over 6M doses right away, more than double what Pfizer delivered in the initial shipment.\n\nThis is happening while the stimulus appears closer than ever, but it should be noted that it does appear it will not include any stimulus checks for citizens. As the Congress seems to be targeting a $750B relief [package](https://ibb.co/pvWY3bB). This is very needed as the savings, especially for low-income households, has been substantially on the [declin](https://ibb.co/SVwG1DD) since May, just like always, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\n\nThis measures from the Government have been unexpectedly just been called upon from Warren [Buffett](https://ibb.co/cv0v8h9) also, as he emphasized that small businesses have become collateral damage, though he previously said he wouldn’t speak in public about this until May, the degrading situation probably made him change his mind. \n\nWe will also have the FED starting its meetings [today](https://ibb.co/jy1TDvh), and follow up tomorrow, with most analysts expecting the FED to lay out the plans for additional asset purchases to provide additional support for the economy. And even if this is a temporary measure, it would be great for the economy if they keep this program going until the vaccine is more widely available and the reopening can come back in full force.\n\nYesterday we also got numbers on the Industrial [Production](https://ibb.co/xG9Rnsr), which beat the consensus with a .4% increase M/M while capacity utilization also increased with the manufacturing output way better than expected. This was led especially by motor vehicle and parts sales which were up 5.3%.\n\nSo, with some good news in the last period, a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/4dn08gY) showed that fewer respondents believe that stocks are overpriced or overvalued right now. I think this is a fair opinion, as we have gone through a period of consolidation since the beginning of [November](https://ibb.co/zVZ3vQQ), stocks have become more stable, some have lost ground, some have gained. This is very healthy for the broad stock market and may eventually start a new bull run very soon.\n\nOn some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/B22drnZ), we saw the whole green energy sector getting a big boost yesterday, as the US Congress seems to have agreed to a [package](https://ibb.co/GxpqGB6) of tax incentives and extensions for both wind and solar projects. Some of the biggest gainers yesterday were SunPower, Enphase, SolarEdge, with most of the companies from the INVESCO Solar ETF trading way higher. As we also saw [PENN](https://ibb.co/7zrVQMG) national gaining yesterday after giving great news again to investors, as they have acquired a new casino in Maryland as they keep expanding their nationwide footprint.\n\nMeanwhile, we will get [Lennar](https://ibb.co/8482vyk) Q4 earnings today after the close, and I expect them to have a great quarter, but this hasn’t helped many companies this quarter, as even great earnings results haven’t pushed most companies to have big gains, I think Lennar will post a terrific quarter as a result of the continuing strong housing market as more and [more](https://ibb.co/QjbZsDz) people flee big cities attracted by better tax implications while they also run from the growing poverty in states like California.\n\nSome good [news](https://ibb.co/rHYtC04) also came from the Eurozone this morning, as the PMI popped up to 49.8 which is still a contraction for the economy, but that is an improving view of the economy overseas, up from 45.3 in November.\n\nWe also have to keep an eye on what [ABNB](https://ibb.co/WPQ214K) and Doordash will do, as investors are starting to get the chance to short this highly valued IPOs. So, this might hit the stocks even more after they have suffered in the last days as I expected.\n\nAnd one last bit of [news](https://ibb.co/j6Fxdv5), Aphria is merging with Tilray, they will become an almost $4B market cap cannabis player, as they seek to also move to the US and grow its market share in the country, as the full legalizing of cannabis in the US seems to be approaching.  This will help both companies to be able to have low-cost, state of the art cultivations alongside improved processing and manufacturing facilities.

Aphria is merging with Tilray while the stimulus may be agreed on today after the latest developments. Also, the FED starts its 2-day meeting, let’s talk about this and everything happening in the stock market**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we see a great day for the stock market, the best in December actually, as a one-two punch of stimulus and vaccine data helped the rally, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/XkRWtZS) finishing up 1.29%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/dPpXW1X) 1.25% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/smC2WMp) 1.13%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/F07KNd4) dropping more than 7% from the recent highs, as it was nearing the 25 levels which would imply more volatility ahead for the stock market.\n\nWe saw ¾ of the companies gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/PG7tysH) on decent volume, with 145 new highs, as all 11 sectors finished in the green, with Utilities and Energy leading the way up almost 2%, while just 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/1sqbPxT) gained less than 1% for the day, the Communications sector and the consumer staples. This rally was pushed by almost every type of [company](https://ibb.co/5xf4s1b), especially small and mid-caps, as large-caps lagged a bit and were pretty much flat for the day, with the exception of Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TT2xp03), as I said in a previous post, I believe that Apple is ready for takeoff after more and more reports of great numbers in the new iPhone 12 lineup sales, and with the Fitness+ service launching this Monday this keeps increasing the number of services that Apple offers. I believe that the Apple One bundle will be a great revenue stream for them alongside the move to the 5G in the next years.\n\nSo here is the economic [calendar](https://ibb.co/dcbS2NG) for today as we start off early in the morning with MBA mortgage applications, followed but retail sales, PMI, inventories and finish up with the last meeting and decisions from the FED in 2020.\n\nWe also received news that as soon as the FDA & CDC give approval, which could and probably will happen as soon as this weekend, [Moderna](https://ibb.co/B3q3Dkv) will be able to ship over 6M doses right away, more than double what Pfizer delivered in the initial shipment.\n\nThis is happening while the stimulus appears closer than ever, but it should be noted that it does appear it will not include any stimulus checks for citizens. As the Congress seems to be targeting a $750B relief [package](https://ibb.co/pvWY3bB). This is very needed as the savings, especially for low-income households, has been substantially on the [declin](https://ibb.co/SVwG1DD) since May, just like always, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\n\nThis measures from the Government have been unexpectedly just been called upon from Warren [Buffett](https://ibb.co/cv0v8h9) also, as he emphasized that small businesses have become collateral damage, though he previously said he wouldn’t speak in public about this until May, the degrading situation probably made him change his mind. \n\nWe will also have the FED starting its meetings [today](https://ibb.co/jy1TDvh), and follow up tomorrow, with most analysts expecting the FED to lay out the plans for additional asset purchases to provide additional support for the economy. And even if this is a temporary measure, it would be great for the economy if they keep this program going until the vaccine is more widely available and the reopening can come back in full force.\n\nYesterday we also got numbers on the Industrial [Production](https://ibb.co/xG9Rnsr), which beat the consensus with a .4% increase M/M while capacity utilization also increased with the manufacturing output way better than expected. This was led especially by motor vehicle and parts sales which were up 5.3%.\n\nSo, with some good news in the last period, a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/4dn08gY) showed that fewer respondents believe that stocks are overpriced or overvalued right now. I think this is a fair opinion, as we have gone through a period of consolidation since the beginning of [November](https://ibb.co/zVZ3vQQ), stocks have become more stable, some have lost ground, some have gained. This is very healthy for the broad stock market and may eventually start a new bull run very soon.\n\nOn some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/B22drnZ), we saw the whole green energy sector getting a big boost yesterday, as the US Congress seems to have agreed to a [package](https://ibb.co/GxpqGB6) of tax incentives and extensions for both wind and solar projects. Some of the biggest gainers yesterday were SunPower, Enphase, SolarEdge, with most of the companies from the INVESCO Solar ETF trading way higher. As we also saw [PENN](https://ibb.co/7zrVQMG) national gaining yesterday after giving great news again to investors, as they have acquired a new casino in Maryland as they keep expanding their nationwide footprint.\n\nMeanwhile, we will get [Lennar](https://ibb.co/8482vyk) Q4 earnings today after the close, and I expect them to have a great quarter, but this hasn’t helped many companies this quarter, as even great earnings results haven’t pushed most companies to have big gains, I think Lennar will post a terrific quarter as a result of the continuing strong housing market as more and [more](https://ibb.co/QjbZsDz) people flee big cities attracted by better tax implications while they also run from the growing poverty in states like California.\n\nSome good [news](https://ibb.co/rHYtC04) also came from the Eurozone this morning, as the PMI popped up to 49.8 which is still a contraction for the economy, but that is an improving view of the economy overseas, up from 45.3 in November.\n\nWe also have to keep an eye on what [ABNB](https://ibb.co/WPQ214K) and Doordash will do, as investors are starting to get the chance to short this highly valued IPOs. So, this might hit the stocks even more after they have suffered in the last days as I expected.\n\nAnd one last bit of [news](https://ibb.co/j6Fxdv5), Aphria is merging with Tilray, they will become an almost $4B market cap cannabis player, as they seek to also move to the US and grow its market share in the country, as the full legalizing of cannabis in the US seems to be approaching.  This will help both companies to be able to have low-cost, state of the art cultivations alongside improved processing and manufacturing facilities. This will also position them for a better footprint in the EU, with Aphria having a footprint in Germany, while Tilray has a low-cost production facility in Portugal.\n\nI think the pot and clean energy sectors alongside the EVs are the ones to watch in the next years.\n\nLet’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/HY1vfFP) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

GOOG   m=     4, s=   284 (post: Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology, comment: ['Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market PsychologyStock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time!\n\nWhen day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.\n\n\\---\n\n3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”. \n\nTrade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade\n\n1.    Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.\n\n2.    Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.\n\n3.    IV Percentile  – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.\n\n4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.\n\n5.    Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.\n\n6.    Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.\n\n7.    Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.\n\n8.    Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.\n\nThis is a write-up i did today to assist beginners AND experienced traders with understanding everything that needs to be understood in the markets.

This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.\n\n\\---\n\n3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”. \n\nTrade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade\n\n1.    Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.\n\n2.    Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.\n\n3.    IV Percentile  – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.\n\n4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.\n\n5.    Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.\n\n6.    Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.\n\n7.    Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.\n\n8.    Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.\n\nThis is a write-up i did today to assist beginners AND experienced traders with understanding everything that needs to be understood in the markets.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) will make up for 1.69% of the S&P 500 index as it makes its debut on Monday’s open, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt.\n\nWhat Happened: Silverblatt said S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio for the coming year will increase from 22.3 to 22.6 with the electric vehicle maker’s addition, CNBC reported Sunday. For every $11.1 Tesla moves, the S&P 500 will fluctuate by one point, as per the analyst.\n\nS&P 500’s dividend yield will dip from 1.56% to 1.53%, Silverblatt said in a note, as per CNBC.\n\nWhy It Matters: Tesla will become the fifth largest constituent of the S&P 500 on Monday with the 1.69% weighting.\n\nSee Also: Tesla's Valuation Is Greater Than Nearly The Entire Established Auto Industry\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the charts with 6.47%, according to Silverblatt. Other companies ahead of the Elon Musk-led automaker include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon .com Inc.

LOGI   m=    16, s=   508 (post: Corsair, Logitech, or...?, comment: ['Corsair, Logitech, or...?This post will be pretty long, comparing a few financial figures and other things like that. Free to have any discussion on a few of the points I make, feel free to call out my logic or anything like that out! Skip to the end where it says "**Final Discussion"** if you don\'t want to read all my breakdown. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR)\n\n2. Logitech International (LOGI)\n\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)\n\n4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF)\n\n5. Plantronics (PLT)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll numbers I post will be off of Yahoo Finance, so excuse me if some of the numbers are wrong. This is purely for discussion, hopefully it creates a good one!\n\n**Revenue/Earnings/Growth**\n\nObviously a huge part of investing (at least for most people - haha), is to know if the company makes money or is on their way to making money; let us take a look. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Revenue* *= 1.1B, Earnings = -8M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 61%, QoQ Earnings Growth = 2294%*\n\n2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Revenue* *= 2.98B, Earnings = +450M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 75%, QoQ Earnings Growth = 266%*\n\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Revenue* *= 235M, Earnings = +18M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 141%, QoQ Earnings Growth = N/A%*\n\n4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Revenue* *= 821M, Earnings = -84M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 25%, QoQ Earnings Growth = N/A%*\n\n5. Plantronics (PLT); *Revenue* *= 1.7B, Earnings = -827M, QoQ Rev. Growth = -11%, QoQ Earnings Growth = N/A%*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a few things are clear from a fundamental revenue/earnings standpoint. The first being that CRSR, LOGI and HEAR are probably the best out of the five. Corsair has insane Earnings Growth, and are almost into positive earnings (remember I\'m just using 2019 numbers). Logitech seem to be solid, with High Revenue and High Earnings Growth. Turtle Beach also seems to be growing at a quick pace. Razers small revenue growth QoQ scares me being paired with the negative earnings; unattractive. Plantonics  is losing a lot of money and their business seems to be slowing down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Institutional/Insiders Ownership**\n\nI am always a big fan of insider ownership (up to a certain point), and even more so when there is high institutional ownership. I think big money always knows whats up, and maybe thats just being a sheep but lets take a look:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Insider Ownership = 5.6%, Institutional Ownership = 91%*\n\n2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Insider Ownership = 1%, Institutional Ownership = 58%*\n\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Insider Ownership = 7%, Institutional Ownership = 66%*\n\n4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Insider Ownership = 59%, Institutional Ownership = 3%*\n\n5. Plantronics (PLT); *Insider Ownership = 2.3%, Institutional Ownership = 96%*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo like I said above, I personally am a fan of both insider and institutional ownership. I like when Insider ownership is in the high single digits or low double digits (5%-12%?). This is because I feel like it gives companies leaders an incentive to work hard (as they own a considerable amount), while also not being able to override every decision a company makes, and instead allow external institutions and investors to have a voice as well. Obviously institutional ownership is good, big money generally means big things. So in terms of the statistics above; Corsair Gaming (in my opinion) has that great mix of insider ownership and lots of institutional ownership. The free float is very small (which may be why it is a very volatile stock). Razers high insider ownership and low institutional ownership scares me a lot, I would stay away from this company (to me thats alarming). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Market Caps/PEG Ratios**\n\nMarket Caps just for reference on "how big" they are, along with the PEG Ratios. PEG Ratio is a metric thats not always used but it relates the price of the stock, the earnings-per-share (EPS) and EXPECTED growth. For anyone that doesn\'t know; 1 is assumed to be a fair value, between 0-1 is "undervalued" and above 1 is "overvalued". I am using PEG because we are comparing companies of significantly different sizes and earnings so it allows us to see if the individual companies are trading at a discount as per the earnings they are making. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Market Cap: 3.23B, PEG Ratio: 0.4*\n\n2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Market Cap: 15.36B, PEG Ratio: 0.94*\n\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Market Cap: 376M, PEG Ratio: 0.66*\n\n4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Market Cap: 2.6B, PEG Ratio: N/A*\n\n5. Plantronics (PLT); *Market Cap: 1.02B, PEG Ratio: 0.58*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we can see, Logitech is the largest one by far, with Turtle Beach being the smallest one. All of them appear "undervalued", perhaps this is the sector? From what I have seen in the Tech Industry it is pretty uncommon to have a PEG ratio between 0-1. As we can see this ratio is not to be taken too seriously, a company like Corsair Gaming has the best one, while Plantronics (despite the large losses in 2020) has the second best PEG Ratio. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cash/Debt/Current Ratio**\n\nShows the position the companies are in, the last metric we will look at. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.

My bottom pick is Plantronics. The main reason is due to their negative growth, negative earnings & piling debt. My second least favourite is Razer. Although a great cash-to-debt position, Razers institutional ownership terrifies me; with a much lower growth rate compared to its peers I would say it explains the downwards slip since going public. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the last 3 left to pick; HEAR? CRSR? LOGI? I think this is where I dive into more than just numbers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurtle Beach had an insanely high run-up back in 2013, but has struggled since. It is also the smallest of these three, and therefore I am personally the least interested. Turtle Beach is famous for their headsets, but the reality is they don\'t have much going on outside of that. Rocccat will boost their sales. Roccat have mice & keyboards, but in a crowded space that is very competitive they are definitely not the forerunners. Their business is, from a fundamentals stand point, not bad right now. But based on the scalability, Corsair and Logitech are my forerunners for this space (specifically peripherals) as I feel they have something more special. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLogitech has been on the market for over 20+ years, and has a pretty impressive growth story over the last 5 or so (\\~600% return). Logitech is a household name; walk into an office and the mice are all Logitech. Keyboards, accessories, speakers; they do it all. Their growth has been very impressive, decent institutional ownership. Have a great cash-to-debt position, can pay short term debt. Logitech seems like a fairly sound investment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCorsair Gaming has just recently IPO\'d. It had a massive run-up and became a \'meme\' stock. It has fallen 40% since then, and to me it seems pretty attractive right now. Corsair Gaming is a notorious brand in the true GAMING industry. Almost every single custom PC built for gaming will have Corsair parts in it. They have insane Earnings growth, are nearly profitable, have an excellent PEG ratio (explained above), and have excellent institutional ownership, paired with the good amount of insider ownership (explained above) as well. They can pay their short-term debt, and their cash-to-debt position doesn\'t scare me as they make over a billion in revenue per year now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the MONEY - GOLDEN, question is : CRSR or LOGI? For me, I don\'t know. Corsair Gaming is 1/5 the Market Cap, and are making 1/3 the revenue. Logitech seems to be growing revenue at a slightly quicker rate than Corsair Gaming, but Corsair Gaming is growing earnings at a much quicker rate; and from a business and investor standpoint, earnings are more important. Logitech edges in peripherals, Corsair edges in custom computer parts. Corsair seems to be the Apple of this sector, while Logitech more like a budget product. The reason I say this is because PC Parts are more expensive than your average computer mouse. For me, a young investor, willing to take on a little more risk & volatility; a smaller company with higher earnings GROWTH is more attractive than a larger company with a slightly smaller one. The higher institutional ownership at the moment of IPO also makes me feel like many people are betting on their growth story. I feel like the possibility for stock price appreciation is higher with Corsair as opposed to Logitech, but maybe you have something to argue?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am open to any discussion, and I\'m sorry for writing an absolute essay. I\'m a gamer, I\'m passionate about this sector. I think regardless of if you choose Logitech or Corsair, some money is to be made in the next few years. Thanks for reading everyone! Always do your own DD, as my findings are not to be responsible for anything you choose to do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck everyone, and heres to a better year!', 56, '/r/stocks/comments/ke2goj/corsair_logitech_or/'])
PLT    m=     5, s=   280 (post: Corsair, Logitech, or...?, comment: ['Corsair, Logitech, or...?This post will be pretty long, comparing a few financial figures and other things like that. Free to have any discussion on a few of the points I make, feel free to call out my logic or anything like that out! Skip to the end where it says "**Final Discussion"** if you don\'t want to read all my breakdown. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR)\n\n2. Logitech International (LOGI)\n\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)\n\n4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF)\n\n5. Plantronics (PLT)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll numbers I post will be off of Yahoo Finance, so excuse me if some of the numbers are wrong. This is purely for discussion, hopefully it creates a good one!\n\n**Revenue/Earnings/Growth**\n\nObviously a huge part of investing (at least for most people - haha), is to know if the company makes money or is on their way to making money; let us take a look. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Revenue* *= 1.1B, Earnings = -8M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 61%, QoQ Earnings Growth = 2294%*\n\n2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Revenue* *= 2.98B, Earnings = +450M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 75%, QoQ Earnings Growth = 266%*\n\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Revenue* *= 235M, Earnings = +18M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 141%, QoQ Earnings Growth = N/A%*\n\n4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Revenue* *= 821M, Earnings = -84M, QoQ Rev. Growth = 25%, QoQ Earnings Growth = N/A%*\n\n5. Plantronics (PLT); *Revenue* *= 1.7B, Earnings = -827M, QoQ Rev. Growth = -11%, QoQ Earnings Growth = N/A%*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a few things are clear from a fundamental revenue/earnings standpoint. The first being that CRSR, LOGI and HEAR are probably the best out of the five. Corsair has insane Earnings Growth, and are almost into positive earnings (remember I\'m just using 2019 numbers). Logitech seem to be solid, with High Revenue and High Earnings Growth. Turtle Beach also seems to be growing at a quick pace. Razers small revenue growth QoQ scares me being paired with the negative earnings; unattractive. Plantonics  is losing a lot of money and their business seems to be slowing down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Institutional/Insiders Ownership**\n\nI am always a big fan of insider ownership (up to a certain point), and even more so when there is high institutional ownership. I think big money always knows whats up, and maybe thats just being a sheep but lets take a look:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Insider Ownership = 5.6%, Institutional Ownership = 91%*\n\n2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Insider Ownership = 1%, Institutional Ownership = 58%*\n\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Insider Ownership = 7%, Institutional Ownership = 66%*\n\n4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Insider Ownership = 59%, Institutional Ownership = 3%*\n\n5. Plantronics (PLT); *Insider Ownership = 2.3%, Institutional Ownership = 96%*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo like I said above, I personally am a fan of both insider and institutional ownership. I like when Insider ownership is in the high single digits or low double digits (5%-12%?). This is because I feel like it gives companies leaders an incentive to work hard (as they own a considerable amount), while also not being able to override every decision a company makes, and instead allow external institutions and investors to have a voice as well. Obviously institutional ownership is good, big money generally means big things. So in terms of the statistics above; Corsair Gaming (in my opinion) has that great mix of insider ownership and lots of institutional ownership. The free float is very small (which may be why it is a very volatile stock). Razers high insider ownership and low institutional ownership scares me a lot, I would stay away from this company (to me thats alarming). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Market Caps/PEG Ratios**\n\nMarket Caps just for reference on "how big" they are, along with the PEG Ratios. PEG Ratio is a metric thats not always used but it relates the price of the stock, the earnings-per-share (EPS) and EXPECTED growth. For anyone that doesn\'t know; 1 is assumed to be a fair value, between 0-1 is "undervalued" and above 1 is "overvalued". I am using PEG because we are comparing companies of significantly different sizes and earnings so it allows us to see if the individual companies are trading at a discount as per the earnings they are making. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Market Cap: 3.23B, PEG Ratio: 0.4*\n\n2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Market Cap: 15.36B, PEG Ratio: 0.94*\n\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Market Cap: 376M, PEG Ratio: 0.66*\n\n4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Market Cap: 2.6B, PEG Ratio: N/A*\n\n5. Plantronics (PLT); *Market Cap: 1.02B, PEG Ratio: 0.58*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we can see, Logitech is the largest one by far, with Turtle Beach being the smallest one. All of them appear "undervalued", perhaps this is the sector? From what I have seen in the Tech Industry it is pretty uncommon to have a PEG ratio between 0-1. As we can see this ratio is not to be taken too seriously, a company like Corsair Gaming has the best one, while Plantronics (despite the large losses in 2020) has the second best PEG Ratio. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cash/Debt/Current Ratio**\n\nShows the position the companies are in, the last metric we will look at. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Corsair Gaming (CRSR); *Cash = 116M, Debt = 396M, Current Ratio = 1.41*\n\n2. Logitech International (LOGI); *Cash = 917M, Debt = 35.9M, Current Ratio = 1.79*\n\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR); *Cash = 27.3M, Debt = 5.5M, Current Ratio = 1.72*\n\n4. Razer Inc. (RAZFF); *Cash = 594M, Debt = 11.8M, Current Ratio = 1.82*\n\n5. Plantronics (PLT); *Cash = 228M, Debt = 1.7B, Current Ratio = 1.38*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we can see, all of the companies are positioned well to pay their short-term debt. Logitech, Turtle Beach and Razer are in fantastic cash positions, while Corsair is in a decent one; and Plantronics seems to be in a bad one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Discussion**\n\nFor anyone that is still here, I\'ll discuss some of the main points, along with my opinions.

Tickers on the watchlist this week: OSTK, PLTR, SPCE, PSTH, BIGMany tickers on my watchlist had big gains last week. I was still able to find a few that have underperformed and might be rotated into once growth stocks take a breather to consolidate. The market and most growth/blue chip tickers were very mixed in performance last week.\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it\'s normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that\'s a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n**Here\'s a few things regarding my strategy**\n\n**1.** I don\'t over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don\'t really see selling multiple spreads as a "Theta Gang" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!\n\nHonestly, that\'s about it. I\'ll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\nI still have a few positions open from last week and my buying power currently sitting at about half my account. Tickers with positions still open: **CODX, FROG, NIO, PLTR, TDOC, U, WKHS**. Most are sitting at 40% profit already and I\'ll be looking to close around 60-70% if we get a good pop. Let\'s see.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don\'t like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I\'ll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week\n\nI just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won\'t execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that\'s why they are on my "watchlist". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OSTK ($62)**\n\n[OSTK - chart](https://imgur.com/Po9EXD0)\n\nI\'m going to bring OSTK back this week after the red day it had on Friday. It\'s still near the lower end of the channel (consolidating) and I can see this getting a bounce back into the $70 zone. Support will be in the $57-58 zone if it continues to drop further.\n\n**Positions On Watchlist:**\n\n1. Jan 15, 2021 $55 put for $3.25 or $325 premium. Return: 6%\n\n2. Buy the dip on some shares and take some off the table as it gets close to $70.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PLTR ($26)**\n\n[PLTR chart](https://imgur.com/bLj6zOo)\n\nImplied Volatility on PLTR has been giving absolutely juicy premiums, however, it seems like it\'s starting to go down after its been in the $25 range the last several weeks. I\'d like to see this stay above $25 next week and then potentially break-out back above $30. It\'s currently at the bottom of the channel, if it breaks maybe we\'ll see back down to $22 support. I like this ticker and will be buying the dip when I can or if I get assigned.\n\n**Positions On Watchlist:**\n\n1. Jan 15, 2021 $24 put for $1.75 or $175 premium. Return: 7.3%\n\n2. Shares are also good here, but I prefer to collect on the high IV while I still can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SPCE ($24)**\n\n[SPCE - chart](https://imgur.com/rXuPjHe)\n\nSPCE had to re-schedule their launch last week and the stock price seemed to be relying on a successful trip. It\'s had some pretty big gap downs last week and is sitting at -30% in the last 7 days. With the volatility the stock has experienced, the trend is difficult to identify. However, I think $22 level will provide good support and some buyers. If not we may re-visit $18 again like it did back in November. I\'ll be testing my luck on this one selling some puts.\n\n**Positions On Watchlist:**\n\n1. Jan 15, 2021 $22 put for $1.37 or $137 premium. Return: 6.2%\n\n2. Shares might be a good entry looking for a bounce play. Like I said, the positions I am entering will be expecting the stock to stay above $22 and perhaps get back into the $25 range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PSTH ($25)**\n\n[PSTH - chart](https://imgur.com/8s6Ok0s)\n\nPSTH had a good run-up recently. Many investors are expecting some big news coming from Bill Ackman. Many rumors floating around for different acquisitions, but nobody really knows what\'s happening. In my opinion as more time goes by then we will be getting closer to a merger. With more exposure the stock has been getting I think the speculation on which acquisition alone will keep the stock above $25. Implied Volatility also not bad here. I\'m going to sell an ATM put on this one. Risk level is a little higher, but any early assignment would actually do me a favor and make my trade more profitable.\n\n**Positions On Watchlist:**\n\n1. Jan 15, 2021 $25 put for $1.50 or $150 premium. Return: 6%. Break-even stock price here is $23.50, so I only need the stock to stay above that in 4 weeks.\n\n2. Might also pick up some shares if the stock dips some more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BIG ($45)**\n\n[BIG - chart](https://imgur.com/nr9F2De)\n\nThis name is somewhat unusual and isn\'t mentioned very much. I\'ve been keeping my eye on it and look at this consolidation it\'s had over the last 3-4 months. It\'s been within a 10% range the entire time, kind of cool to see. It\'s had a big gap down and a massive red candle Friday.

VIE    m=     1, s=    27 (post: When researching a stock, how and what do you do?, comment: ['There’s an app called “Simply Wall St” that compiles the financials of tens of thousands of companies in one app and presents them in a very organized and aesthetically pleasing way. Whenever I hear a stock tip or read something about an intriguing company, that’s the first place I check.\n\nThe app doesn’t always get everything right unfortunately; sometimes the listed number of shares outstanding isn’t correct, or things like that. It’s usually pretty accurate, but it’s good practice to review a company’s actual financial statements just to be sure everything checks out. These can be found online very easily.\n\nAfter that, if the financials look alright, I’ll usually read a couple of articles about the company if I can find them. Seeking Alpha tends to have some good information in my experience. I usually stay away from the Motley Fool and Zacks, as they often write very clickbait-y articles about popular (overvalued) stocks. I also don’t lend a whole lot of credence to this subreddit. I can’t say I’ve never gotten good information from those sources, but it’s rare. \n\nIt’s important to have a good understanding of the company in question: i.e. its operations, the headwinds and tailwinds it’s dealing with, whether or not it has a durable competitive advantage, etc.\n\nThen, if I like the company, I do a calculation to determine the stock’s intrinsic value. No matter how much I might like a company, I won’t touch it unless I’m getting a fair price. That’s how long-term alpha is generated. I keep this information in my phone’s notes app, but any way you like to keep things organized is fine.\n\nIf, when you’re following these steps, you see something that you don’t understand, Investopedia has some really good informative articles about almost any investing topic you can imagine. For example, one time I read a Seeking Alpha article that mentioned that a company I was interested in had a VIE structure. Not knowing what that meant, I found an Investopedia article explaining it in pretty good detail, and I actually ended up making that stock my largest holding.\n\nDo your due diligence on every investment opportunity. Find stocks that you’re certain are good investments. If you’re uncertain, pass it up and look for another opportunity. One activity I’ve found helpful when thinking about initiating a new position is to imagine that you have to put your life savings into only one stock for the next 5-10 years. Would you be comfortable if that was the stock? If your answer is no, or you’re not sure, the stock shouldn’t be in your portfolio at all.\n\nLastly, don’t stop researching even after you buy a stock. Always be on the lookout for industry disruption or economic changes that make the stock less attractive. If you owned Blockbuster’s stock in the late 2000s, you’d be foolish to ignore Netflix’s rise. It’s also important to be aware of positive changes; any Apple shareholder worth their salt should know about the success of Apple’s M1 chip.\n\nI apologize for giving such a long response, but I hope this helps. Good luck in your future investments :)', 27, '/r/stocks/comments/khl522/when_researching_a_stock_how_and_what_do_you_do/ggmpg60/'])

People know that they are one of  the places where they can get a decent selection of games.  The website  is prime real estate in our transforming digital society.\n\nThere  are humorous videos of people flipping out in game stop because they  feel that they are being done dirty when they try to sell them last  year\'s Call of Duty and get offered 6 dollars.  However, this beats  nothing, which they will get if they download directly onto their  consoles and harbor a license in perpetuity.\n\nWhat  I\'m saying is that Game Stop has their name brand website that isn\'t  doing shabby.  Sales have increased 800 percent.  It\'s smart of them to  close down under-performing stores as they are no longer needed.  The  key thing is the website is able to generate sales at a fraction of the  cost of maintaining stores.\n\nIn my shitty opinion, it seems like everything is overvalued, except this stock.\n\nAs  of press time, game stop\'s total market cap is under a billion dollars  in a day and age where everything is worth billions of dollars\n\nPersonally,  I have a pretty speculative portfolio, and when I look at market caps,  it amazes me that the following companies are bigger than gamestops  paltry 900 million cap.\n\n1. NIKOLA\n2. MindMed valued at 1.2 billion yet is still traded OTC and is "not a going concern"\n3.

GME is an intellectual property  play as well. By this virtue, I sincerely believe gamestop should be a 6  billion dollar company at least with a serious price target of 69.42  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nAND PS....WTF.

BILL   m=     1, s=    28 (post: Stock Market News Today | FED Meeting News | Stimulus Deadline? FedEx & Lennar Earnings [12-17], comment: ['Stock Market News Today | FED Meeting News | Stimulus Deadline? FedEx & Lennar Earnings [12-17]**What did the FED reveal yesterday after the meeting? FedEx reports today after Lennar smashed earnings results. Is today the stimulus deadline? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/Nj34Qdp) leading the way up 0.5% and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/WcwDrN2) also finishing in the green, up 0.18% and ended over the 3700 level for just the 2nd time in history, while the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/Sdvkw4L) lagged and lost 0.15%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/w62QhvW) continuing to drop 1.7%, back to some more normal levels after the recent spike near 25.\n\nDespite the broad market rally [yesterday](https://ibb.co/Z2qpxL2), about 55% of companies were losing ground on average volume, as we saw the Tech and Consumer Discretionary [sectors](https://ibb.co/BftQNpd) leading the way, while the only sector losing more than 1% for the day was the Utilities sector. As only Large-Cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/cyY67bQ) from the tech sector finished in the green, while small-caps and especially value play lagged behind.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/5LKrKdx) that most of the big tech names, Microsoft, Amazon, NFLX and even Alibaba which has suffered lately finished up well into the green, while the industrials and utilities were a big block of red.\n\nWe also got some economic data yesterday, with business [inventories](https://ibb.co/jZndKhQ) rising more than expected as sales increased by 0.9% month over month. We also saw retail [sales](https://ibb.co/XjqJyhW) falling 1.1% in November from the previous month, but this may be misleading, as sales actually rose by more than 4% year over year and by almost 6% after stripping out auto, gas and retail sales. \n\nWe also continue to see the housing demand market being [strong](https://ibb.co/cTT9BjX) as the housing market index was down from the previous month, but came in at the second highest level ever.\n\nOne last number that we got was a reading on the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/Mg0pgHq), which came in at 55.7, below expectations and the last month number. This was the lowest reading in three months as growth momentum keeps slowing down as more restrictions are re-imposed, but this is still a strong expansion of the manufacturing and services.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/fGq6Bqc) we will get some critical economic data, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims and housing starts, while we will also see get other important numbers later in the day.\n\nSo, we also got the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/ynQhYRg) yesterday, which for me personally, was a good indicator that stocks may still go up, as the bullish number of investors declined by 4.6%, with most of them switching to a neutral view of the stock market. There are still a lot more investors that are bullish compared to the historical average of 38% but, this is an improving in the last weeks, as this is a very good contrarian indicator. When more people tend to be bearish that is usually a good sign that you should just go and buy stocks, as you can mostly buy them at a discount, while when to many people are bullish, there is a significantly bigger risk of a pullback or correction nearing the stock market.\n\n[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/5BwsTzH) we saw the FED keeping rates unchanged and signaling that they will continue to keep a near-zero rate through 2023 to support the economic recovery.\n\nThey also announced that the economy is expected to contract by only 2.4% in 2020, that is a big improvement from a contraction of 3.7% previously expected. They also expect the economy to grow by 4.2% next year and by more than 3% in 2022, with both revisions also being up from the previous estimates. They also vowed to keep buying bonds until there is substantial economic progress in the US, so they are expected to continue to buy $120B, with $80B in Treasury securities and another $40B in mortgage-backed securities.\n\nOther revisions in the projected economic data also showed an improved outlook in the unemployment rate, which is expected to drop to 3.7% by 2023.\n\nThe FED Chief Powell also reinforced the commitment to aid the economy with even more easing if it deems it necessary while also suggesting they will give ample warning before tapering bond purchases.\n\nThis was happening while the congress was still haggling over details on a bigger $900B relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/PQBrH2Y). We also saw a major change from the last day as now it is expected that it will include a 600$ stimulus check and extended unemployment benefits. I think this must be agreed on as soon as today if it stands a chance of passing by the end of the week, even if Congress leaders have repeatedly told they will remain in session as long as needed, even working through the weekend, they should just put their act together and pass the stuff they can agree on so that uncertainty goes away, at least for the moment.\n\nWe also have some interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/vHCS87T) reports coming today with FedEx, BlackBerry and General Mills.\n\n[FedEx](https://ibb.co/D89m06D) is expected to post an EPS of over 4$, that would be up almost 60% over last year with an operating Margin of 7.1%. FedEx has also just received an upgrade from Credit Suisse based on accelerating e-commerce trends with a longer and stronger holiday season than expected.\n\n[JABIL](https://ibb.co/tL2qNRb) just reported while writing this post a nice surprise due to the high demand in the new Apple lineup, with a beat of 34 cents on earnings and almost $800M on revenues. The stock skyrocketed after the release.\n\nWe also got [Lennar](https://ibb.co/f9pLZxP) earnings after the close yesterday, as they beat the estimates easily, while also offering better numbers in new orders and guidance. As they expect more than 62K deliveries and 24% gross margins in FY 2021, that is up from 53K and a 20.6% gross margin in FY2020, this pushed the stock up 3% in after hours, in an unexpected move to the upside for me, despite my expectations for a great quarter for the company.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/C82FmBg), we saw Roku gaining more than 5% in after-hours, after they finally reached an agreement with Warner Media to make HBO Max available directly to their streaming business.\n\nMeanwhile, gambling seems to be getting a boost every other day, as the most [recent](https://ibb.co/YhtQJH9) comment from Cuomo, made investors feel like gambling could become a big source of income for the state of New York. This boosted companies like DraftKings and Penn Gaming even more, as gambling is coming faster than expected in the entire country. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/1QdMW97) also managed to strike a deal to launch a brand-new retail gift card just in time for the holiday season. This will be available in multiple convenience stores and is a good way for DraftKings to attract even more users to their platform in my opinion.\n\nWe Also saw [companies](https://ibb.co/yVS3v1H) lose ground yesterday like Fiverr which dropped in early trading before recovering to finish -2% for the day, after a report that Facebook is eyeing an entry into the gig business, this would be a major competitor that could eat up a lot of growth that Fiverr expected\n\nLet’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1zf63r8) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!
