Investing the rest may or may not pay off either - \ncertainly pays off if you did with a start date of 1985 - you'd be at $779k nominal in the S&P 500 after 15 years, but start in the year 2,000 you'd only be at $326k nominal after 15 years, or start in 2002 and be at $370k nominal after 15 years. \n\nAfter 15 years the house would be paid off, you'd be short $135k-$179k under these disaster scenarios, and you'd be considering paying off the remaining 15 years you still owe on and made giant interest payments within the first 5-7 years. \n\nAt year 10 of the 15-year mortgage the payoff is $117,483.53      \nAt year 10 of the 30-year mortgage the payoff is $238,606.83      \n\nUnder the worst case year 2000 stock market case we're at:        \n$113,000 stock market gains + cost basis. \n\n238,606.83 payoff-113,000*.85= 142,556.83. 117,483.53  -142,556.83 = -25,073.3 worse than the 15 year mortgage.         \n\nYear 2002: $140,000, $119,606 payoff after taxes, -2,122.47 worse than the 15-year mortgage\nYear 1985: $201,472  $67,355 payoff after taxes,  $50,128 BETTER than the 15-year mortgage.  \n\nAt year 15 of the 15-year mortgage the payoff is $0.      \nAt year 15 of the 30-year mortgage the payoff is $189,622.47      \n\nBut now, I'd have to realize capital gains on that amount, likely highly appreciated being 15 years in. Let's just do the worst case of 100% capital gains:          \n\n326,000*.85-189622.47 = $87,477 ahead of the 15 year mortgage for a paid off house.       \n\nSo, it really depends on your goals. If given enough time, yes, it is mathematically advantageous to invest in the difference, but the shorter you're desiring a paid off house before your FI date to avoid the extra $505k SWR requirement, the more advantageous the 15 year becomes compared to the riskiness of the stock market in the short term. \n\nSo, all three cases were ahead of the 15 year mortgage with my cherry picked dates, but at 10 years one was clearly worse, one was a wash, and only a bull market was significantly better than the lower interest mortgage rate of investing to then reduce the payoff number.", 1, '/r/investing/comments/keg8s6/fed_commits_to_keep_buying_bonds_until_the/gg3a36u/'])

So we decided that companies that relied mostly on travel would be hit the hardest. We looked at airlines, but figured they could easily repurpose/rent to logistics related stuff, which would actually increase (obviously we were wrong, but it was a thought at the time) and ended up choosing cruiselines. I picked RCL and he picked CCL. He sold his contracts like 4 days later because they had jumped like 450%. I actually sold mine 2 days prior to the no-sail-order and it was mostly just because I was concerned there might be something up their sleeve for repurposing cruiseships and I was running out of time on the contracts at that point. But even with the no sail order, when I sold my contracts on March 12th the price was around $32/share. And the lowest it ever got was around $22. \n\n\n\nSo I guess in the end it wasn\'t PURELY luck.. there was definitely about 3-4 hours of conversation that went into it.

I think there\'s a couple of things being conflated in the messaging. First, a 3-fund portfolio isn\'t going to get you some kind of multi-digit percentage return most of the time. You invest in a 3-fund portfolio if you\'re trying to preserve your money. Comparing a 3-fund portfolio to (insert growth fund here) isn\'t quite a fair comparison because the goals are different.\n\nAdditionally, I will point out that thematic investing isn\'t new. ARK and others have been following themes to great success, and as long as the theme remains hot (technology, clean energy, genomics, medical devices, etc.) the funds will continue to do well. [IHI](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=IHI&allocation1_1=100), for example, has done a compounding return of of 15% per year since inception (2007), blowing away the SPY in all metrics (less drawdowns, higher return, lower volatility, etc.).\n\nTraditional thinking states that you can\'t beat the market over time, so why even bother trying. People who believe this accept it as fact, when there are so many other factors involved (e.g. was the person who picked stocks buying the same stocks every time they got paid?).  I expect this notion to be challenged over the next decade, and quite frankly, I hope the thinking dies out. There are plenty of funds and folks buying baskets of stocks (e.g. 10-20 stocks) especially now with fractional shares weighted for specific targets and are continuing to ascend to new highs.\n\nAs much as people want to speak poorly of strategies that differ from their index investing, rarely have I ever seen someone address the elephant in the room which is, "By not investing in the index, you were able to beat the index." I\'ve had many debates here about this because there is a camp of diehards who refuse to look at any kind of alternative data. If I say [here\'s an example of a basket of 3 stocks that has beat the SPY for the past 26+ years](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=100000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=MSFT&allocation1_1=33&symbol2=WM&allocation2_1=33&symbol3=INTU&allocation3_1=34), is that enough evidence to show that consistently beating the market is at least *possible?? (put your pitchforks down, I did not say guaranteed).* I\'ve been talking about this for the entire lifecycle of this reddit account, so it\'s nothing new.\n\nIf you\'re a person who is looking for outsized returns, you\'ll need to go outside the index.

Then scan the WHOLE market.  When the scan shows a hit, check your resources for valuation before placing an order to buy.  If it is under or fair valued, maybe a buy is good.  Also, you can take current price and look for last breakup price on a 1HR chart (look left)...a falling oversold stock has a good chance of retesting breakup lows / breakout areas.  Buy there for a better price.\n\nLastly, the only thing IMO that has changed is buying and holding certain companies forever.

What do people invest most money in then other than high value companies?  Yeah, take fliers on TSLA and NIO and SNOW and PLTR, but at the end of the day, just like dot.com survivors, not all flier companies will make it, so those guesses have to be minimal of account value. The ones with balance sheets will win.  It may take a while to see, but why risk hard earned dollars just guessing.

Invest in them, and wait for AMZN to show profit, then buy AMZN.  Still would have made very good money eventually buying AMZN when it went (+).\n\nHow do you find these high value companies?  Just take the top % in each industry and look at intrinsic value.  When they\'re undervalued and oversold, buy.  Can also use Fidelity or TDA or Schwab data on value to make assessments.  Also, simplywall.st has a $ valuation.  I rarely buy something with no data or overvalued on all 3 sources.

Ark has absolutely by far the best marketing/communication strategy of perhaps any fund offering I can think of. They are constantly in the media, doing various presentations, the daily reports, etc.  Baillie Gifford does some of the same sort of thing but not to the same degree.\n\nThe only thing I\'d like to see is some discussion of the risk and potential downside/volatility with this sort of investing. She said the other day she was confident her investments "will return at least 20% annually, more than doubling over the next five years." There\'s no discussion of the risk and the kind of drawdown these sorts of funds can have, it\'s all "tremendous (*at least* 20% for the next 5 years - after the kind of year for returns that is rare) upside"  and I think people are entirely taking this year and focusing on the upside and not what goes up a lot also has the potential to reverse just as significantly. \n\nObviously, she\'s trying to gain AUM but even a sprinkling of realistic expectations and discussion of long-term focus beyond what might be considerable volatility in the short-term at times would create more long-term shareholders vs people who love Ark now but will not and flee the next time there\'s a major correction. Create even slightly more realistic expectations that can be exceeded vs predicting tremendous returns annually for the foreseeable future.\n\n And when you have a year like Ark did now you have people who are talking about "100% of their portfolio in Ark" - and these are discussions people are having *after* the funds are already up 130%+ YTD. What % of their portfolio is going to be in Ark if there\'s a quick 20% decline (rotation out of this year\'s winners, correction?) If the Ark funds had a 20% correction, they\'d still have an amazing 1yr record, but the people late to the party who went "100% ARK" probably wouldn\'t be so happy.\n\n"Ark\'s focus on openness and marketing could also be seen as a downside for a potential investor"\n\nThe only thing that concerns me is that with the kind of inflows that are being seen and the increasing amount of focus and discussion on Ark down to people seemingly waiting every day and tweeting out the Ark daily trading reports (there\'s even a Twitter account devoted to those; https://twitter.com/ArkkDaily) - it all starts to feel increasingly overcrowded.\n\nIn March, people on here were uber-bearish, to say the least. Now an increasing topic is "how many Ark funds do you own?"  Some names have gone increasingly nutty - RDFN a great example (https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=RDFN)  I\'m not saying that "MARKET CRASH IMMINENT!" or something, but between names going parabolic and people piling into Ark-style aggressive growth, a significant correction at this point would be healthy.\n\nPeople seem to giddily wait for the daily Ark reports to be published and it\'s like, "OOOOH Ark bought something I own equivalent to 0.001% of the fund, I think I\'ll buy more!" It feels a little like performance chasing on top of performance chasing, but hey, Ark has an unbelievable year and puts out their holdings every day and people pile into the funds and probably chase the stock holdings that they are buying in these daily reports on top of it. \n\nI think my whole thing is definitely not "Ark bad" - not at all. It\'s not "aggressive growth bad" by any means. It\'s more people should curb their enthusiasm a bit/not wholly and completely  performance chase after growth had an unusually fantastic year that - unless "this time is truly different" is highly likely not going to be repeated.\n\nIn a way the whole thing is sort of on brand for a very bizarre year, though -\n\nif someone told me last year that there would be a pandemic but I\'d have a really fantastic year investing, I\'d have laughed. \n\nIf someone told me in March that by the end of the year people would be basically throwing money at the most aggressive growth funds on the planet, I\'d have laughed too.', 2, '/r/investing/comments/kg89w8/with_how_much_the_world_has_changed_the_past_30/gggn5yg/'])

A great book to understand the severity of 08 is Stress Test. People can pretend they knew what was going to happen but literally the financial and real estate market of the US was in free fall and the world followed. Subprime mortgages were given to owners as a result of Clinton’s admin to expand home ownership and the derivative market and bundling of said sub prime mortgages crippled the financial institutions that underwrote them. Legit Lehman’s went under. There was a massive run on banks and US printed money to prevent AIG, the largest insurance company in the world, from going under which would of just made the situation worse. They needed to restore confidence in the US banks and the dollar. Eventually the mania stopped but as a result, people who were over leveraged by taking out a loan on their over inflated housing price or white collar worker who lost a job as a result reduced spending in the economy and stagflation happened for years. The feds raised interest rates long before 08 to try to curb peoples enthusiasm about taking out loans to invest which then hurt them once the down turn happened. \n\nThat is also why during covid we see QE to help keep the market liquid but with what some say has been artificially held low rates so that the fed can pay back debt easier during an extended bull market instead of raising rates there was a very close floor to use QE. Since their was no room for QE during covid since rates were so low, the fed had to resort to printing money and giving stimulus checks during the federal stay at home orders. Post 08 the concern was stagflation since no one had purchasing power but with covid the concern is hyper inflation due to the amount of money introduced into the economy.\n\nAn equivalent to Lehman’s going under during covid would of been Boeing. Sorry for the tangent on covid. Thought there were decent parallels.\n\nAs for the dot com, I wasn’t old enough for that nor have I read any specific book on it but the short of it is any company that had “internet” of “.com” associated with it were priced like the next Microsoft.

Maybe the new era think that after the millennium things would be different never came to fruition or maybe there were no longer any suckers to buy the stock higher than the price someone paid for it. The term “irrational exuberance” was coined during this time period in the early 90s by treasury secretary basically tell people to curb their enthusiasm about equity. \n\nNo one knows exactly when we enter a bubble nor do they know when it will pop or what causes it to pop but it will come.

PLUS   m=     1, s=     6 (post: How to do proper due dilligence research?, comment: ['Hey /u/BigFatDan1, I am a graduate student in finance with a bachelor\'s degree in Accounting. I wrote my thesis on how macroeconomic policy affects US equity markets (equity markets = stock market). I\'ve spent the last 3 years studying this stuff and I\'d say that I am not qualified in any sense to give sound investment advice. What that should tell you is that the stock market is an extremely complex landscape and takes years to understand. Even the best of the best lose money. With that being said, this comment is for informational purposes and not to be taken as investment advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, understand that the last ten years does not accurately represent equity markets historically. From 1925 to 1941, if you invested in the S&P 500 index, you would have seen an average annual return of less than 5% with several of those years being negative- over the next **ten years**. Same goes for 1960 to 1975. (Disclaimer: Before people tear me apart saying you can\'t invest in the S&P 500 directly, I know. I\'m using it as an example.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe\'ve experienced a remarkably strong bull market over the last ten years, with 20% annual returns on the S&P 500 index; however, just because we\'ve had a strong market the last ten years does not mean it will stay that way. Consider Japan in the early 1990s. Their bull market turned into a bubble (google: financial bubble) and for the next 10 years they saw no long term growth in their equity markets. They call the 1990s in Japan, "the lost decade". So this begs the question: if there are 10, sometimes 15 year long periods where we have almost no growth, or perhaps negative returns, when, where, and why should I park my money in equities?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing I think you should understand is **risk**. Risk is at the heart of almost all things "investing". If you go to the casino, and place $5,000 straight at the roulette table, your payout is a massive 35:1. If your bet hits, you walk away with $180,000. But statistically, your chances of winning are less than 3%. The risk is massive. Alternatively, if you buy a 3-month US treasury bill, the payout is around .1%. Meaning you would made $5 on a $5,000 investment. Why? The risk is so low. Also, wtf is a 3-month US treasury bill? Let me explain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA US Treasury bill is a short-term government debt security. Here\'s how it works. You give the US government $5,000. They now owe you $5,000 PLUS interest at a future date. In this example, it\'s 3 months. The US government says, "Thank you! We will give you $5,005 back in three months!" In three months, they give you the money back. Ask yourself, if you had to guess the percentage likelihood of the US government collapsing in the next three months, what would it be? Pretty low, right? That\'s why the return is so low. The United States government has the power, means, right, and infrastructure to tax the wealthiest population on the planet. They also aren\'t going out of business anytime soon. Therefore, that $5 return on a $5,000 investment is essentially guaranteed. [Check out this chart.](https://www.stillmanbank.com/investment/your-2020-investing-resolution-pay-more-attention-to-risk/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo all stocks sit somewhere on this line of risk and return. But, how do we know the risk and return? Great question! Let\'s start with a better question. How do we assess the value of an **asset**? An asset\'s worth is the sum of its future cash flows discounted to today\'s dollars. Read that again. *An asset\'s worth is the sum of its future cash flows discounted to today\'s dollars.* This is what we call "Net Present Value".

NPV    m=     3, s=    17 (post: How to do proper due dilligence research?, comment: ['Hey /u/BigFatDan1, I am a graduate student in finance with a bachelor\'s degree in Accounting. I wrote my thesis on how macroeconomic policy affects US equity markets (equity markets = stock market). I\'ve spent the last 3 years studying this stuff and I\'d say that I am not qualified in any sense to give sound investment advice. What that should tell you is that the stock market is an extremely complex landscape and takes years to understand. Even the best of the best lose money. With that being said, this comment is for informational purposes and not to be taken as investment advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, understand that the last ten years does not accurately represent equity markets historically. From 1925 to 1941, if you invested in the S&P 500 index, you would have seen an average annual return of less than 5% with several of those years being negative- over the next **ten years**. Same goes for 1960 to 1975. (Disclaimer: Before people tear me apart saying you can\'t invest in the S&P 500 directly, I know. I\'m using it as an example.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe\'ve experienced a remarkably strong bull market over the last ten years, with 20% annual returns on the S&P 500 index; however, just because we\'ve had a strong market the last ten years does not mean it will stay that way. Consider Japan in the early 1990s. Their bull market turned into a bubble (google: financial bubble) and for the next 10 years they saw no long term growth in their equity markets. They call the 1990s in Japan, "the lost decade". So this begs the question: if there are 10, sometimes 15 year long periods where we have almost no growth, or perhaps negative returns, when, where, and why should I park my money in equities?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing I think you should understand is **risk**. Risk is at the heart of almost all things "investing". If you go to the casino, and place $5,000 straight at the roulette table, your payout is a massive 35:1. If your bet hits, you walk away with $180,000. But statistically, your chances of winning are less than 3%. The risk is massive.

Has it been increasing? Leverage isn\'t bad, but it can be the make or break if the company comes on hard times.\n\n* When is their debt due? High leverage with 10 years to maturity isn\'t a concern right away. High leverage due next year in a weak economy is a huge concern (but don\'t underestimate a companies ability to renegotiate debt, all parties involved are usually highly motivated to make things work - it just might wipe out the equity value to do so).\n\n* How much disposable cash flow are they generating? Cash from Operations less required payments like interest, leases, maintenance capital, dividends...

Companies like Snowflake, Airbnb, Doordash and Palantir\\* have been standout IPOs this year. Snowflake’s IPO was the biggest US software IPO in history while Palantir’s stock price has more than doubled since going public in September.\n\nIt looks like this IPO trend could continue well into 2021 with some of the biggest names in tech expected to go public. Here are 5 of the most anticipated IPOs for 2021.\n\n***\\*Note:*** *Palantir went public via a direct listing, not an IPO.*\n\n### 1. Robinhood\n\nThe stock-trading platform looks set to go public in 2021.\n\n2020 has been a massive year for Robinhood. In Q2 of 2020, they made revenue of $180 million. Up from $91 million in Q1 of this year. Revenue growth of 100% in a single quarter is incredibly impressive.\n\nRobinhood hasn’t been without controversy this year. Many people cite the app’s popularity as a big contributing factor into the high market volatility we’ve seen.\n\nRobinhood’s growth plans seem to be centered around providing more financial products to its US customers, as opposed to expanding into international markets. It launched Robinhood Crypto in 2018 and a 1.8% interest rate savings account in 2019. This was around the same time that plans to launch in the UK and Australia were postponed. It will be interesting to see how this growth strategy plays out and if international expansion gets a renewed focus in the future.\n\nAll of the signs seem to be pointing to an IPO in the first half of 2021. A Reuters report states that Robinhood have partnered with Goldman Sachs to begin IPO preparations at an expected valuation of over $20 billion.\n\n### 2. Gitlab\n\nWhile not a household name, Gitlab is an impressive company that looks set to go public in 2021. Gitlab is a SaaS company that markets a DevOps platform which allows their customers to build software more efficiently.\n\nGitlab is an interesting company to say the least. All of its employees are fully remote. Meaning that Gitlab doesn’t have a corporate office and employees can work from anywhere in the world. Gitlab is a proponent of the “open-source” software model and sells its software under an “open-core” business model. This is where the core functionality is released under an open-source (MIT) license while the additional functionality is under a proprietary license.\n\nGitlab’s business has been performing very well. When it last raised money in September 2019, it announced that its revenue growth rate was 140% year over year. In January of 2020, Gitlab hit an annual revenue run rate of $120 million.\n\nGitlab had originally planned on going public in November of this year. But in May, they decided to hold off on these plans due to the uncertain economic outlook at the time. However with the recent performance of tech IPO’s, you can expect that they will be going public sooner rather than later.\n\nGitlab is currently valued at over $6 billion, after shares were sold in the secondary market in September of this year. That’s more than double its valuation when it raised money in September 2019.\n\n### 3. Stripe\n\nStripe is a SaaS company that provides payment processing services and other financial products to businesses of all sizes.\n\nStripe is one of the most valuable startups in the world. Its most recent round of funding valued the company at $36 billion.\n\nRevenue numbers are hard to come by for Stripe, but a recent interview with co-founder John Collison shows the scale of the business:\n\n>*Mr Collison said that 200,000 new businesses have signed up with Stripe since March. “Those businesses, since March, have already processed more than $20 billion in revenue,” he said.*\n\nStripe typically charges 2.9% per transaction. So a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that Stripe earned almost $600 million since March **ONLY** from companies that have signed up to Stripe since March. Their actual revenue numbers are obviously much higher.\n\nThere is no hard evidence that Stripe will go public in 2021. In fact, in the same interview, Mr.Collison stated that “We have no plans to IPO”. However, a recent major partnership with Salesforce and the hiring of a high-profile CFO from General Motors seems to signal that an IPO might not be too far off.\n\n### 4. Bumble\n\nBumble is a dating app with a twist - on Bumble, only women can make the first move when a man and a women ‘match’.\n\nMatch Group (owners of Tinder) are the major player in the online dating space. But Bumble seems to be catching up. Bumble posted revenue of $240 million in 2019 and has 100 million users as of 2020.\n\nBumble’s growth strategy seems similar to that of Tinder in that it offers premium features such as “Bumble Boost”. But a key part of their growth strategy also seems to be to move outside of just dating. They recently launched two major products; BFF helps you to meet new friends while BIZZ helps you to network more effectively.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, Bumble just recently confidentially filed for an IPO in February 2021. The expected valuation range is $6-8 billion.\n\n### 5. Instacart\n\n2020 has been a massive year for the grocery-delivery company, Instacart.\n\nSimilar to other delivery companies like Doordash, the pandemic brought on a massive spike in demand for Instacart. In March, order volume on the platform jumped by over 500%.\n\nInstacart’s valuation has grown in line with its order volume this year. It grew from $7.9 billion at the beginning of 2020 to more than $17 billion by October.\n\nInstacart looks set to be planning an IPO for 2021. A recent Financial Times report stated that the company is consulting with banks ahead of a potential IPO in early 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat IPOs are you most excited for in 2021?', 542, '/r/investing/comments/kfuc0v/5_ipos_to_watch_for_in_2021/'])

Look at $ABNB, originally priced at $68 but by the time it opened for trading it had doubled. $DASH ranged between $90-$95, went live at around $182.  FOMO makes IPO's ridiculously overpriced, however, people throw their money at them straight away, and in these two cases doubled their values. I generally watch their opening price, wait 3 working days at least, then look again. If I were to have bought in to either of these stocks then I would have save my self $20 per share. I don't buy IPO's, by the way. I need to see how the market reacts to them, and how they react to it.\n\nI often wonder how these IPO's are priced - pick a number out of a hat? Random number generator?\n\nHow did $DASH come to have a market cap of $72B when they made over half a billion loss last year and have solely relied on the pandemic. They currently have a margin of -12% and intend to turn that around to +8% whilst at the same time growing revenue. It just won't happen. Especially once the pandemic is behind us and less people rely on food deliveries. I don't doubt this year will be good for $DASH - just compare them with $UBER, who pretty much do the same thing and more. They're currently up 68% despite not being profitable.\n\nDo you buy or have you bought any IPO?", 26, '/r/investing/comments/kfuc0v/5_ipos_to_watch_for_in_2021/ggba7ub/'])

IP     m=     7, s=    79 (post: Can we have a difficult discussion about Tesla?, comment: ['Thought this was relevant since on 60 Minutes Elon mentioned how they give up all of their patents for the good of mankind and he\'s willing to let the company go bankrupt.\n\nSummary: Yes you can use Tesla\'s patents, but if you choose to do so, you are giving up all of your patents as well.\n\nIn 2014, Elon Musk announced that he was "open-sourcing" Tesla\'s patents. He argued that doing so would allow the electric vehicle market to grow more rapidly. While Musk\'s original announcement was short on details, the company has since provided additional information regarding the use of Tesla\'s patents in its Patent Pledge. Echoing language from Musk\'s announcement, the Patent Pledge states that Tesla "will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing a Tesla Patent through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith."\n\nThe Patent Pledge provides a potential path for companies to use the technology covered by Tesla\'s patent portfolio. Tesla is the assignee of over 350 U.S. utility and design patents covering a broad range of technology, from thermal management systems to door handles. However, companies considering whether to use Tesla\'s patented technology should carefully review several key restrictions found in the Pledge.\n\nAs quoted above, Tesla\'s agreement not to sue a party for patent infringement extends only "for so long as such party is acting in good faith." The Pledge goes on to state that a party is acting in good faith as long as they have not:\n\nasserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment; challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; or marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so. These conditions could have significant legal and business implications for a company using Tesla\'s patented technology.\n\nFirst, the Pledge states that those acting in good faith will not assert any patent or intellectual property right against Tesla. Note that a company using Tesla\'s patented technology is not only giving up the ability to bring an action against Tesla for patent infringement, but any form of intellectual property infringement. This includes trademark and copyright infringement, as well as trade secret misappropriation. Thus, for example, if Tesla copied a company\'s source code line-for-line, that company would be required to forfeit the protection provided by the Pledge in order to enforce its rights.\n\nOf potentially even greater consequence, the Pledge states that a company is not acting in good faith if it has asserted "any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment." Therefore, before using technology from a Tesla patent, a company must determine whether it is willing to agree not to assert its own patents against any company operating in the electric vehicle market anywhere in the world. This may be a trade-off that a company is willing to make, but it is not a decision that should be taken lightly. Among other implications, this decision may have a significant impact on the value that investors place on the company\'s IP. If competitors are able to use the patented technology of the company, it may be difficult to establish a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\n\nThe second restriction limits a company\'s ability to challenge the validity of a Tesla patent. This is similar to language found in many intellectual property license agreements. However, there are a few things to note. First, this restriction applies to any Tesla patent, not only the one that the company is using. Second, the Pledge requires that the company not have any financial stake in a challenge to a Tesla patent. The term "financial stake" could be quite far reaching. For example, Tesla could argue that a supplier has a financial stake in its customer\'s challenge of a Tesla patent.\n\nFinally, the third restriction withholds the protection of the Pledge from those who market or sell a "knock-off" or provide material assistance to another party doing so. The Pledge does not provide a definition of "knock-off product," but it does provide one example: "a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla." Hence, a company using Tesla\'s patented technology must be careful in its product design to ensure that Tesla cannot assert that it is selling a knock-off.\n\nTesla\'s Patent Pledge presents companies in the electric vehicle field with a tremendous opportunity, but one that also carries some substantial risk. Agreeing to abide by the Pledge could significantly curtail a company\'s ability to protect, defend, and assert its own intellectual property. A company should weigh these implications against the benefits of using the technology before deciding to take advantage of Tesla\'s offer. If the company does decide to use Tesla\'s technology, it should put processes in place to ensure that it does not violate the conditions of the Pledge and, as a result, lose the protections that it provides.', 50, '/r/investing/comments/kggxr1/can_we_have_a_difficult_discussion_about_tesla/ggfx1x7/'])

What exactly are Tesla\'s component businesses that are different than car companies? Let\'s analyze:\n\n* Making cars - obviously same as car company\n\n* Providing driver automation systems - also same as a car company. Many manufacturers utilize Mobile-Eye (they make money on the integration) or have their own solution such as Argo AI for VW / Ford, GM Cruise for GM, etc\n\n* Making batteries - Tesla does not make batteries. They partner with battery makers and oftentimes just buy from cheap suppliers like they do in China and hence the China battery scandal. GM is also partnering with LG Chem. VW is doing joint partnerships too and already has 15 million cars worth of batteries locked up. BYD Auto is the largest battery maker already. GM has the ultium battery that is comparable to Teslas "secret sauce". VW with it\'s investment in Quantum Scape has next generation battery. Toyota is the only one with Solid State batteries will make a limited test vehicle in 2021. There is no Tesla battery secret sauce.\n\n* Powerwall, etc - Again, each company already has or is entering this space. For example, BYD B-Box by BYD Auto. Or just the equivalents from the actual battery makers (LG Chem, Panasonic Smart, Fortress Power, etc).\n\n* Solar - yes, this is the one Tesla component that is not found in other car makers. This was a failing business that was taken over from his cousin (nepotism) and was a really shady business deal. The business segment has poor YoY growth (which is why he had to save his cousin\'s biz with a merger) and it is highly competitive.

DB     m=     2, s=   496 (post: I think I'll have to give up trading, too many losses., comment: ['Do not trade, just invest. They are not the same thing in my opinion and two completely different games to play. With respect to investing, my overall philosophy, attitude, and position is to simply not give a fuck and not use my brain too much. Trust me, I know how ridiculous, stupid, and counter-intuitive that sounds as well. So, let me elaborate on this stance:\n\n1. Personally, for me, regardless of conditions, there will never be change in plan/strategy (within the foreseeable future). As an individual with a stable income, high job security, DB Pension, and a decent emergency fund, I am always 100% equities and there will never be a change in buying more or less. Simply, I invest on average, half of my pay, every time I get paid (i.e. every two weeks) and I do not give a fuck about government stimulus, wars, low growth times, high growth times, COVID vaccine, no COVID vaccine, "all time highs", "all time lows" or wherever the fuck we are on the "graph". I do not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, I really do not give two shits. Volatility does not mean anything to me since I am a super long-term investor (25-50 years) and I do not respect it or fear it.\n\n2. I realize that I am not an intelligent individual, I recognize that I am not an educated individual (i.e. high school only), I acknowledge that I cannot predict the future, and I certainly cannot time the market over the long-term. I believe that time in the market is superior to timing the market (as per academic studies). Therefore, I will continue to invest on average, half of my pay every two weeks because I am boring, I do not give a fuck about market volatility, and I do not have materialistic wants or needs.\n\n3. Don\'t try to "get rich quick", don\'t attempt to "buy low, sell high", don\'t buy shit/garbage, don\'t buy penny stocks, don\'t buy "meme stocks", don\'t worry about "missing out" (i.e. FOMO), don\'t worry about other people\'s gains (fuck everyone else), and/or don\'t try to do some smart shit like "day trade". This is not a short-term or medium-term game for me and it should not be for you either. Your mind should be on the future and you should be laser focused on building wealth slowly through the passage of time. Delayed gratification pays off and academic studies have demonstrated that delayed gratification is one of the most effective personal traits of successful people (whatever the fuck "success" means in those specific studies).\n\n4. You should consider investing in an "index exchange traded fund" or "index ETF" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors (such as you and I) will underperform an index ETF over the long-term if we choose to pick individual stocks.\n\n5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people here want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage and as long as you have a long time horizon. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity. The last thing you want to do is panic and sell your investments. It is said that the most important organ in investing is not the brain, but rather, the stomach. Turn your brain off, be disciplined, and "stomach" these temporary dips, crashes, recessions, and/or bullshit events. Instead, embrace these times of opportunity since everything goes on sale; and therefore, you get to buy more securities/assets at a discount. Basically, do not fear these times, embrace them with open arms alongside a smile and let the weak minded/stomached people panic sell to you as they shit their pants. You do not even need to rob these folks because they let you rob them and then these people think that you are doing them a favor by giving them money in exchange for their undervalued assets/securities. In the past, there have always been bullshit macroscopic events that are out of our control and we have always gotten through it (less the Japanese Nikkei and perhaps some other markets but this is part of the game as well as the risk you take in investing).\n\n6. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks (i.e. when you get paid) regardless of what happens (even if this time is "different" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, strong stomach, long-term minded investor with a high degree of delayed gratification who just doesn\'t give two fucks). Simply put, just buy as many fucking bricks as you can every two weeks until you retire or die and slowly build your castle\'s infrastructure as time progresses. There are no guarantees; however, you should have a pretty solid castle in the end.\n\n7. Finally, again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens with the world, economy, politics, monetary policy, fiscal policy, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). These events are things outside of your own control, so fuck it. "Catastrophic" events have happened before and they will continue to happen within your lifetime. So, you need to mentally prepare yourself and accept this fact as part of your investing journey until your existence in this universe has ceased. It is absolutely imperative and crucial that you continue with an unshakable discipline and plan to buy globally diversified index-ETFs and/or well-established, high-quality companies with wide economic/competitive moats with complete disregard and disrespect for macroscopic events out of your control.\n\nKeep buying as many bricks as you can when you get paid, stop giving a fuck, stop using your pre-frontal cortex in attempts to do "smart shit", strengthen your stomach, and good luck with both personal finance as well as investing!

One thing that I’ve learned is to try to filter out the cacophony of hype/panic that often surrounds various investments. \n\nVocal bulls are often just trying to reassure themselves over their decision to put their own money into something reckless, and vocal bears are often just trying to convince themselves that panic selling was a good decision. I try to keep in mind that there is often an ulterior motive behind ANY investment advice, even if it‘s subconscious/psychological. I try to find companies I genuinely believe will do well in the period of time I intend on investing (100+ days, 5+ years, 20+ years, etc.), because at that point the difference between buying the dip and DCA becomes less significant. \n\nWhen I go for the former strategy, I’ve found I’m often better off not buying in on the first day of a dip. The market is overreactive, and I often end up getting a better price by waiting for a few days to see if it continues to fall. ETSY is a good example, as their share price dropped for like a week immediately after Q3 earnings, despite giving a positive report. If I had bought that first dip, instead of waiting a few days, my average share price would be substantially higher. Alternatively, if I notice multiple dips reverse themselves within a couple days, and shares continue to climb, I tend to take that as a sign that I should jump in sooner rather than later. \n\nGranted, I have no idea what I’m doing, and you should probably ignore me along with 99% of the people on this sub.', 2, '/r/investing/comments/kdegdp/buy_the_dip_or_just_buy_strategies_for_building_a/gg025f5/'])

So you're looking a big wad of regulatory credit income this year that is essentially non-recurring under current contracts.  That's not to say next year they couldn't sign a deal with say Ford and Daimler together and get a similar amount of income but FCA is kind of singular in both the volume of cars they sell and how far they are behind fleet emission targets in the EU.  VW was as of 2018 facing the biggest estimated penalties too but will only incur around 300M euros this year versus the 4.5B euros they were expected to pay back in 2018 and are on track to pay no penalty next year.  So the ability for other large automakers to meet compliance internally, which is pretty much the general plan in the medium term, is doable.  The act of doing so also places additional pressure on Tesla's market share in the region since it all but forces these automakers to offer more competitive PHEVs and BEVs at volume.\n\nHowever for Q3 specifically they would have made money regardless specifically because they ate a higher tax payment as a result of realizing regulatory credits anyways.  So they were GAAP positive Q3 regardless and that's probably a big reason why they finally got index inclusion after those earnings versus back after Q2 earnings when people were initially speculating about the possibility.\n\nOverall Tesla will also recognize some level of regulatory credits too simply because at least some of them are GHG credits here in the US that have some non-auto based buyers market.  However the ZEV credit market that they utilized heavily a few years ago is essentially dead right now since all automakers have credits stocked up to last them through at least 2023.\n\nAll that said I think the bigger issue just comes down not so much the profitability but the disproportionate impact regulatory credits have on their overall margin numbers as well as the overall sustainability of their business model in light of increasing competition.  Tesla has lived in this little bubble for several years where real competition didn't exist specifically because there was minimal regulatory pressure for incumbent automakers to pursue the market.

[\\(See all holdings\\)](https://pastebin.com/GhMZuBbe)\n\nEach fund has it's pros and cons. For example PBW has much longer history and you can trade options on it. But PBW is also higher in expense ratio at .7%, which seems kind of high compared to CTEC's .5% -- especially considering all PBW is doing is following an index. \n\nHowever, the question I want to focus on is whether you would invest in a fund that's mostly US-centric, or one that's more diverse? Which one offers more growth? More security? Why do you feel this way?

Major elements of the changes include reducing tax rates for businesses and individuals, increasing the standard deduction and family tax credits, eliminating personal exemptions and making it less beneficial to itemize deductions, limiting deductions for state and local income taxes and property taxes, further limiting the mortgage interest deduction, reducing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and eliminating it for corporations, reducing the number of estates impacted by the estate tax, and cancelling the penalty enforcing individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).The Act is based on tax reform advocated by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that under the Act individuals and pass-through entities like partnerships and S corporations would receive about $1.125 trillion in net benefits (i.e. net tax cuts offset by reduced healthcare subsidies) over 10 years, while corporations would receive around $320 billion in benefits.\n\n[About Me](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) - [Opt out](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) - OP can reply !delete to delete - [Article of the day](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

DK     m=    22, s=   842 (post: DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) - Deep Dive Research, comment: ['DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) - Deep Dive ResearchHi everyone! I am working non-stop provide the best research and analysis regarding DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). I originally posted my overall investment thesis on the company a few weeks back and now I am breaking down and analyzing the latest news and developments regarding DKNG! And no, it is not the ticker symbol for Donkey Kong.\n\nDraftKings in my opinion, is the best pure play investment if you want some exposure to the sports betting, iGaming, and daily fantasy sports space. They\'re founder led (3 founders to be exact) and they\'re invested into the company themselves right alongside all of us shareholders or potential shareholders.\n\nWithin the last week, there has been some exciting developments regarding DraftKings. I will share them below:\n\n**DK Gift Cards Are Live! You can buy a DK gift card as a stocking stuffer for Christmas if you want.**\n\nI’m really excited to hear this news. It’s only going to increase the  brand awareness of DK and that’s what we want. According to the press  release on DK’s investor relations website, they’ve partnered with  InComm Payments to facilitate the launching of the gift cards. InComm  payments is a global leading payments technology company that has a  network of retailers that DK will be able to leverage through this  partnership.  Convenience stores like 7-Eleven, Speedway and Dollar  General are just some of the many convenience stores in Incomm Payments’  network that DK will be able to leverage. For now, the gift cards will  be offered in $50 and $25 denominations.\n\nThe great thing about this to me is that they’ve beat their  competitors to this. That shows managements initiative and ability to  get things done which I complimented when I first picked this company.  As of right now, you’re not going to be seeing any “FanDuel” (boo  FanDuel \\*thumbs down emoji\\*) gift cards in the stores. Tim Richardson,  the Senior Vice President at InComm Payments was quoted as saying  “DraftKings will benefit from having its brand present in tens of  thousands of Incomm Payments’ retail partner locations across the US”.  Overall, good news for DK.\n\n**New York State – Getting desperate? Do they need some online sports gambling revenue?**\n\nI want to make this clear before I write about this topic – sports  betting is already legal in New York state. The problem is, it’s only  legal in brick and mortar (retail) locations. Just under a dozen upstate  casinos can operate brick and mortar sports books at the moment. In  typical DK fashion, they’re already active in a casino in New York  State. DK offers in person brick and mortar sports betting through the  Del Lago Resort Casino in Waterloo, NY.  My news update I’m sharing is  that it appears New York state might be considering expanding to online  sports betting too due to a budget shortfall they’re experiencing (they  need more tax revenue).\n\nThis news came out on Wednesday, 12/16/20 during the day time.  Governor Cuomo had a press conference during the day. The press  conference was primarily focused on giving an update on the COVID-19  pandemic in New York state. During the presser, the topic of New York  state’s budget shortfalls came up. As a possible financial solution,  Cuomo said “Are there other ways to get revenue? How about marijuana?  How about sports betting?” He’s referring to the possible tax revenue  that could be collected if sports betting offerings were expanded beyond  just the brick and mortar offerings. What if every New Yorker could  place a sports wager from the comfort of their own home on their cell  phone?\n\nThe battle for legalizing online sports gambling in New York has been  going on for years. Governor Cuomo has always been opposed to it. One  of the reasons Gov. Cuomo has cited in the past is that he thinks a  constitutional amendment would need to be made to New York state law to  allow for mobile sports betting in the state. However, one state  representative from New York that has been pushing hard for online  sports gambling begs to differ. In response to Cuomo’s comments in the  presser earlier that day, State Senator Joseph Addabbo said that there  would be no constitutional problem with mobile sports betting because  the servers could be placed on site of grandfathered in physical  casinos. Addabo said that New York state’s need for revenue is “real and  immediate”\n\nThis is a situation to keep a close eye on. The impacts of legalizing  mobile sports betting in NY would be substantial for DK as it would  open the population of 20 million people in NY state the opportunity to  place wagers on the DK Sportsbook app through the comfort of their home.  I imagine it wouldn’t be too difficult for DK to mobilize once they get  the green light for mobile betting as they already have the standing  relationship with Del Lago Resort Casino for in person betting.\n\n**The Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) granted DK a  provisional license to conduct online gaming and sports betting in the  state of Michigan**\n\nFor this update I also want to be clear – retail (brick and mortar)  and mobile sports betting are already legal in the state of Michigan.  It’s just that there’s a lot of yellow tape for Sportsbooks like DK to  navigate within a state even after sports betting has become legalized.  This provisional license provided by the MGCB was provided to DK and 14  other sportsbooks (including rival FanDuel) on Thursday, December 10th  last week.\n\nNow there are just a few more regulatory requirements that DK has to  meet in the state of Michigan before they can go live. According to [http://www.michigan.gov](http://www.michigan.gov/),  “Before launch happens, the platform providers must complete additional  regulatory requirements including independent testing of platforms and  games and MGCB approval of their internal controls, which ensure gaming  integrity. The firms also must secure occupational licenses for certain  employees.” You can read the full article on Michigan’s government  website [here](https://www.michigan.gov/mgcb/0,4620,7-351-79256_98027_97974-547154--,00.html).\n\nKnowing that DK has a knack for being quick to mobilize once they’re  given opportunities in respective states, I fully expect them to pass  these last few tests with flying colors. The DK Sportsbook app has  already been available in the state of Michigan for “free to enter”  games. Once they pass the last few requirements, actual wagers will be  allowed to be placed. And money will be allowed to be made!\n\nAnother promising sign coming out of the state of Michigan, is that  on November 30th, 2020, DK became an official sports betting partner of  the Detroit Pistons, the NBA basketball team in Michigan. DK Chief  Business Officer, Ezra Kucharz, was on the record after the deal closed  saying “As our first professional team activation in the state of  Michigan, we are thrilled to join forces with the Detroit Pistons ahead  of our pending market introduction”. In my opinion, I anticipate we’ll  be seeing DK online sports betting in Michigan some time in early 2021.\n\nThis concludes my update and analysis on DraftKings.\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n* Draftkings now offers gift cards and you can buy them in convenience stores (first sports betting company to do so)\n* DraftKings received a provisional license to conduct sports gambling in Michigan\n* Governor Cuomo of NY said he would consider legalizing "mobile sports betting" to raise additional tax revenue\n* If you would like to read my original deep dive and analysis on DKNG, you can check it out here:\n   * [DraftKings Deep Dive and Analysis - Investment Thesis](https://onthemarkpicks.com/2020/11/30/deep-dive-1-part-1-of-2-draftkings-bringing-sports-to-life/)', 40, '/r/investing/comments/kf3xjj/draftkings_nasdaq_dkng_deep_dive_research/'])

CAN    m=     1, s=     1 (post: The Dangers of Passive Investing [Seeking Alpha], comment: ["Active mutual funds beat their index all the time.  The consistency by which they do so is rare, this is why the longer the term that you look at the more evidence you find of passive index investing beating actively managed funds.  The problem with actively managed mutual funds is this example.\n\nLet's say you are a talented manager with great ideas.  You start the actively managed mutual fund called SUPERFUND.  You gather investors that like your ideas and you begin to invest.  In the first year, you beat your market index by a significant margin.  Investors/media see this and pour more money into your fund.  You beat the index again and again, now your 3yr performance is still market beating.  Your fund continues to grow as more people pour money in.  At some point, your great ideas start to become hampered by the amount of money being invested into your fund.  You cannot have money sitting in cash uninvested, like Warren Buffet can do with Berkshire until the right opportunity comes along.  So your performance (alpha) starts to erode, and you are forced to buy into larger cap investments solely based on the volume of money you are managing now.  Finding a small company that doubles/triples/quadruples in value doesn't move the needle on billions of dollars invested, and there are only a handful of those opportunities annually.  Eventually you end up parking the bulk of your money in either a market index fund or a group of stocks the represent a large portion of the index and using a small % of your portfolio to try to generate alpha.  If your system is perfect, you still beat the market index.  But if you make a mistake, or cannot find enough opportunities for alpha, you'll just as easily fall behind.  Once you begin a losing trail, money will bleed from your fund, and eventually they will close it down to investors and start a new version of it in hopes of creating the next winning track record, because no one invests in funds with losing records against their index.\n\nTLDR: The point is, stock pickers and active managers CAN beat the market.  But they struggle to beat the market over the long term because the deck is stacked against them.  There are exceptions, like Renaissance, but they aren't open to the public and their strategies likely work because of that.  Beating the market requires strategies that are on a small scale.  This is why Warren Buffet the legend himself, his performance has declined as Berkshire has grown (returns were greater early on).", 1, '/r/investing/comments/keclnt/the_dangers_of_passive_investing_seeking_alpha/gg956t2/'])

Child prostitution and slavery went up rampantly after that (sorry I don’t have the sources as this was provided in presentation by someone else with sources). So is child labor unethical, I suppose, but the lack of said labor lead to what I would deem much worse consequences. Bottom line is that “ethics” is really complicated. \n\nImo the best way for me to ethically invest is to grow the fuck out of my portfolio and then do what I can PERSONALLY to ensure WITH MY OWN EYES that I am making positive change. Its a lot tougher to enforce ethics on a company when you are never really getting the full story on a factory operating 5000 miles away than it is to put food in an impoverished family’s pantry. “The path to hell is paved with good intentions” is a good quote to remember here concerning ethical investing.

CCS    m=     1, s=    -2 (post: Why is Tesla worth so much? / Confused european, comment: ["> And then we have companies and cars like KIA E-niro, Nissan Leaf, **Toyota with their EVs**, and the US biggest rival Chevrolet (GM). \n\n... Remind me what models Toyota has on the market today that are *battery electric vehicles*. You can't, because there aren't any. They only have plug-in hybrids, which are primarily a gasoline vehicle.\n\nAlso have you seen the sales of Nissan Leafs? They've been **decreasing** over the last few years while the size of the EV market has been expanding exponentially. Most people in the EV market just don't want a Leaf. Worse yet, Leafs use CHAdeMO standard for charging instead of the modern CCS technology that literally everyone else who isn't using their own standard (Tesla) is using, so I really can't blame people for staying away from it for that reason.\n\n> The car manufacturing industry is highly competitive and I don't see how Tesla can increase their revenue or even take 5% of the electric vehicle space.\n\nIgnoring the rest of Tesla's businesses, a few big factors here are in Tesla's favor I feel you're discounting.\n\n* Tesla builds a software oriented car, and software is an increasingly important part of our lives. If you care about over the air updates, and high quality software you'll go for a Tesla. Most of the other automakers have struggled a lot with writing good software, or straight up outsource it to third parties. VW's ID3 had it's release held up for several months because of software issues.\n\n* Relating to the last point, over the air software updates keep your car constantly fresh. Whereas without it, it eventually feels like stepping back in time when you get into your old car. Again, Techies love Tesla's software.\n\n* Tesla has adapted to modern times by selling cars online, instead of making people deal with awful car dealerships that literally everyone hates. As someone with terrible social skills and lots of social anxiety this alone is reason for me to buy a Tesla over any other vehicle I can't buy online.\n\n* The traditional automakers are moving too slowly to adapt to the shift to electric and self driving vehicles. In my honest opinion, given the rate that battery prices are falling, and how Tesla plans to release a $25,000 BEV in the next 3 years, I think the sale of brand new ICE vehicles (where most traditional automakers sales come from) are going to drop to **near zero** in the next 4 to 5 years at most. It simply won't make economic sense to buy a brand new ICE vehicle, they'll be **more** expensive then EV's. Any automaker who hasn't shifted heavily towards EV's by then is going to go bankrupt (or get bailed out by a government) in my honest opinion. Virtually all the traditional automakers have plans that are just WAY too slow at shifting to EV's. (Note: Yes people will still be buying ICE vehicles in the used car markets in 5 years, but that's not going to pay the bills at their ICE producing car factories)", -2, '/r/investing/comments/kf6ufv/why_is_tesla_worth_so_much_confused_european/gg7l5b7/'])

So in this case, Air Canada is releasing 35,420,000 shares to the public to buy.\n- The price they are offering them at was at $24 a share. \n- $24 x 35,420,000 = the $850,080,000 they are hoping to get out of this, which will be a new source of revenue for them.\n- what they do now.. who knows. \n- The deal to take over Transat just got approved by the shareholders, so if AC was planning on going bankrupt, what would the logic be here? (Really, I\'m asking!) \n- AC has "restructured" in the past. They went bankrupt in 2003 and took 18 months to "restructure". I\'m not sure, but I believe investors lost everything. I think that was the point of filing for bankruptcy.\n- The CEO is in talks with the government for a bailout package. The government seems to want AC to refund passengers their money for their canceled flights due to COVID and is using that as part of the negotiations in the deal. \n- This could mean AC is going to have to spend more money (but, they are on their way to getting that 850m from this new share offering).\n- From other things I\'ve read, another share offering usually results in a big dip, as they want people to buy, and though it\'s crappy for current investors, it\'s supposed to help support the company for the future.\n- The CEO has said he thinks it will take 3 years to get back up to it\'s all time high. \n\nSo what now? If you believe AC won\'t go bankrupt, and reach it\'s all time high in 3 years, you could buy now and hold, and take your 33% increase each year (on average). \n\n- 3 years from now I don\'t think COVID will be a thing, so I kind of want to hold, even though I bought in at 27 :( :(\n\nA big thing on my mind though is; is there a point to buying out smaller airlines just to declare bankruptcy? Will they be able to declare bankruptcy, continue to own everything in these airlines they buy, then "restructure" with a new name/company and start fresh? This sounds highly illegal if it\'s deliberate.. but does anyone know? I don\'t trust big companies when billions of dollars are on the line, and at the end of the day, they will do what it takes to save the most money, and to make the most money...', 8, '/r/investing/comments/kegu7u/air_canada/gg41fg7/'])

There’s not a lot of utility scale solar except a few places in the country.In the future it might be 100% wind and solar. \n\nThe big problem with powering the grid with wind and solar is that you can’t store it. In my region the electric grid might be powered by 60% wind one minute when the wind is blowing and 2% another minute when it’s not. \n\nUtilities are just starting to build large scale storage.

Automotive products are capital intensive and too expensive to fix if its not designed properly and rolled out. I am okay with TM taking a decade to design a proper EV that can run for decade versus pushing something too soon. \n\nTSLA is shining because there is not a competitor but you can exactly think about the YAHOO being a search engine and GOOGL just launched their search product. Someone would make it right (or most of it right) and can kill TSLA with a stone. For EVs you need a network of chargers, a proper battery tech and added software features but the very foundation of a proper car is something TSLA is missing in the equation. Look at the number of recalls made on TSLA with Model Y for [flying roofs](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/360551) problem, a company like TM cant get around it without losing reputation. Established companies have reputation at stake when people lives are at their hands but with new entrants people are little more forgiving especially when there is NO REAL ALTERNAIVE *at the moment*.  \n\nScaling a tech company and automobile company are two very different challenges. Market pricing and reaction are done on what is existing in the market now but not about what can be on the horizon. TSLA valuation for now dictates them as the single biggest player in EV market but certainly that doesnt mean someone with decades of car building experience cannot enter into the market, build and win one. Europe already showed whats possible with VW iD cars with recent sale numbers and I wouldn't be surprised in five years we have TM spinning out M3 equivalents. The Japanese are so good at their [craftsmanship](https://youtu.be/9z1R0G_RCFw?t=925), just give them their time.", 2, '/r/investing/comments/khg7sn/comparing_yhoo_and_tsla/gglmyp1/'])

CF     m=     7, s=    50 (post: A coming boom from Crowdfunding and SPACs?, comment: ['A coming boom from Crowdfunding and SPACs?Something very exciting and special is happening in the world of capital fund raising for emerging market and startup companies. Recently, new SEC rules will allow “Crowdfunding” sites to increase the maximum amount of capital that can be raised by companies from the general public. \n\nCrowdfunding is a confusing term for some. To be more precise, Crowdfunding would be more accurately referred to as “Crowd-Investing”. When speaking of “Crowdfunding”, some people mistake it for the activity of sites like GoFundMe or Kickstarter, and thus think it means donating money to a cause and perhaps for a token reward. In reality, Crowdfunding sites like Wefunder and StartEngine open the doors for regular folk to invest in the emerging market and startup community that used to be the exclusive domain of venture capital firms and institutional investors. \n\nThus John and Jane Q Public can login to one of the Crowdfunding sites, browse the companies opening their doors to investment, and invest $100, $1000, or more in a company that may be high risk, but also may be high reward. The world of reaping potential 10x, 100x, or more returns on investment is at everyone’s finger tips just as it has been for venture capitalists (VCs) with their million dollar plus investments. Only, in this case, at a level at which the individual investor feels comfortable. It’s an opportunity to “get in early” on a company that may track toward a massive acquisition or IPO. \n\nThere are two primary paths to Crowdfunding for companies. The first is leveraging “Regulation CF” which currently allows companies to raise up to $1.07M from the general public. Regulation CF funding has SEC filing requirements for companies via a “Form C”. However, the requirements are something most companies can easily fill out, have an independent CPA review financials, and maybe a lawyer help with risk disclosures, in 2 weeks to 2 months time. Crowdfunding portals make it even easier to file the Form C and tap into the crowd as well. The other path, is a “Regulation A” round which currently allows companies to raise up to $50M from the general public. However, the filing requirements are a little more involved. It may take 1 to 4 months to complete the work required to file for a Regulation A raise and most certainly requires help from lawyers. [Note that Regulation A is also sometimes referred to as Regulation A+]\n\nIn the January to February 2021 timeframe, new SEC rules will take effect which up the limits that are allowed to be raised. With Regulation CF filings, companies will be able to raise up to $5M. And with Regulation A filings, companies will be able to raise up to $75M. This is a game changer because these limits become more in line with what many startup and hi tech companies seek to raise in more traditional venture capital rounds. Thus, with this route of funding, more companies will be able to raise the kind of capital they need to grow their company to the point of being fully self sustained by revenue and further growth. \n\nThe vast majority of venture capital is deployed to companies located within spitting distance of the major venture capital centers like Silicon Valley, New York, and Boston. Being from a Company located well outside of these zones (Charlottesville, Virginia), and having talked to hundreds of VCs, there is a common and natural hesitancy for VCs to want to invest outside of their region of operation. Jumping on a plane and traveling through airports hours on end once a month for board meetings is not always desirable. Furthermore, VCs also naturally understand best the environment in which they are located and affiliated. They understand and know the talent pool, other sources of capital in the area, and resources that exist in their region of operation best. When a Company in Charlottesville, Virginia or elsewhere in Anytown USA pops onto their RADAR, these questions swirl about and add further risk in their mind to the deal. \n\nWith Crowdfunding, by nature of its more distributed nature, more potential investors exist who have familiarity with a company’s region. Furthermore, many crowdfunding investors simply don’t care as much about location since they’re not going to have board seats at the company and be traveling on planes for meetings. Thus, with the increase in the limits of Crowdfunding investment to the tune of $5M and $75M for Regulation CF and Regulation A respectively, it feels like there is a movement afoot that will lead to a dramatic increase in the number of companies seeking investment via this route. \n\nWhat’s more, there has been a recent uptick in hi tech companies going through the traditional IPO process by way of “SPACs”, or Special Purpose Acquisition Companies. These are shell corporations formed to be publicly traded that merge or acquire the company with the real meat on its bones offering some product or service of value. SPACs allow such meaty companies a faster path to going public. There’s an increasing spate of hi tech companies pursuing this route with the potential for huge returns on investment as a result.\n\nIf you combine Crowdfunding with SPACs, it seems there is a real disruptive process in the air for capital fundraising taking place. Whereas many startup and hi tech companies traditionally need to be located in locations with a high cost of living just to raise capital and then undergo a lengthy process to going public, the increased limits for Regulation CF and Regulation A, combined with the rise in popularity of SPACs revolutionizes capital fundraising. \n\nCapital fundraising becomes more democratized via Crowdfunding, lowers barriers, and increases the velocity of capital fundraising by companies no matter where they are located. Furthermore, the velocity for going public is also increased by SPACs. Crowdfunding alone seems likely to lead to a boom in innovation and hi tech company growth across the land. Crowdfunding plus SPACs seem destined to provide a powerful one two punch for companies looking to knock it out of the park and become a publicly traded company along side others on the major stock exchanges. \n\nThis isn’t a theoretical realization. Having raised capital thus far through traditional VC routes for a hi tech autonomous vehicle company located just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, far removed from Silicon Valley, I’ve experienced first hand the complications. It’s already difficult to raise venture capital. It’s even more difficult to build a company around autonomous vehicle technology vs say building a company around more commoditized infrastructure like Web site and mobile App platforms. Add to the mix doing this from outside of a region that’s one of the few VC hotbeds, and the pace of capital fundraising can come slowly. \n\nThe promise of increased pace of capital fundraising that Crowdfunding via Regulation CF and Regulation A offers combined with the promise of going public faster offered by SPAC formation is reducing the friction and removing barriers that have more recently been ahead of companies like ours. Beyond our previous and current traditional venture capital fundraising efforts, we’ve started down the concurrent path of raising more funds via Crowdfunding. In future articles, I will provide further details on this new era of capital fundraising based on industry developments and direct experience. In the meantime, keep an eye out for the broader industrial boom that seems to be on the horizon.\n\nPaul Perrone\nFounder/CEO - Perrone Robotics\n\nReferences:\nCrowdfunding: https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/11/168682-the-sec-updates-reg-cf-reg-a-and-more-boosts-reg-cf-to-5-million-reg-a-increased-to-75-million/\nSPACs: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/business/dealbook/deals-mergers-acquisitions-2020.html\nAuthor Contact: https://www.perronerobotics.com', 8, '/r/investing/comments/kgzis4/a_coming_boom_from_crowdfunding_and_spacs/'])
