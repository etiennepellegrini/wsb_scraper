Lucas scooped a couple spoonfuls of egg onto her plate (Le Frenchies Dessert Plates, gift from daddy) and poured her a hot cup of coffee (Haviland Brandenburg Gold Tea Set from Neiman Marcus, also a gift from daddy). She shoveled the eggs into her cakehole and asked who made breakfast while she waddled over to the pan (nonstick) to get more. I replied “Lucas”, to which she immediately started SCREECHING like a fucking banshee about how she didn’t want a insert bad word for gay touching her food.

ACA    m=     1, s=     7 (post: 70k to 1M in 1 year, comment: ["**What are the purchasing habits of a cannabis consumer?**\n\nCannabis is unlike alcohol and tobacco and caffeine. If you are a user please back me up on this or argue with me, I’d appreciate either one. What brand of marijuana do you smoke? Chances are if you grew up drinking you know the brands your crew partied with. If you grew up smoking cigs, you know the brand you liked and you probably still smoke the same thing. From my perspective, cannabis flower is going to be particularly difficult to brand. Typically the smoking process involves grinding whole bud in order to roll your own joint/blunt or pack the pipe/bong. Where is the branding happening?\n\nThe thing I remember when I was smoking regularly is who had that fire, who had the mids, and who had the schwag. Your dealer brands themselves with the quality they provide. I would put up with a lot to get the Humboldt grown fire over the trash one of my buddies had. The funny thing is you can tell immediately just from smoking. The quality of the grow brands itself into your mind. It can be the same exact strain, with the same exact genetics, but if it is grown without the proper knowledge and care the result will be wildly different. Alcohol and cigs and caffeine, it all hits the same pretty much, no matter what your brand is you are consuming a fairly uniform experience. I think of it as a superficial difference vs. a fundamental difference. Expertly grown and crafted cannabis will brand itself. You can put it in a paper bag and users will ask for the paper bag stuff. This is a key concept to understanding where the potential profit is in this industry and who may become the leaders.\n\nFor evidence of this look to Colorado which is one of the most competitive and challenging environments for cannabis businesses to thrive. I recently drove around Denver to a bunch of the top rated recreational dispensaries. The main store that stood out was A Cut Above. Middle of the day on a weekday IIRC I waited in line for an hour. Everywhere else I walked in and I walked out. Part of this is the size and limitations of their store but demand was clearly the highest for their product in the area from what I saw. I haven't had a chance to smoke anything but check out r/COents and ACA is a place that brands itself by the quality it provides. 14er in Boulder does a better job with presentation IMO and seems pretty popular with good offerings as well. If you’re a smoker from CO chime in, I’m sure you may disagree and I’d appreciate your input. \n\nI believe these same principles from the cannabis black market will transfer to the legal market such as I saw in CO. The dealers with schwag or sub par offerings will be laughed at and business will be limited. Essentially cannabis and the properties of cannabis make it a connoisseur product naturally. I think the closest comparison is the craft beer market. Small batches, unique brews/strains, expertly crafted and cared for products will be where the big money/profits are. This is a low margin environment.\n\nThis is why cannabis cultivation is not a good business to invest in. The most successful player will understand these concepts and not overextend their grows. They will create small batches that are tended carefully. Margins aren’t ever going to be great and prices will never be higher than at initial legalization. Can a mega grower provide consistency of product at mass scale? Maybe. Cannabis cultivation just doesn’t suit the timetables of public corporations and their goals to show ever increasing profits and business dominance. Likely the cannabis cultivation winner in terms of revenue will buy a bunch of independent small batch growers alongside a well run and carefully maintained mega grow operation. I do imagine there will be some normalization to higher quality eventually and it is possible at this point we may see brand loyalty differentiate producers. This will take quite a bit of time to develop in my opinion. A lot of the white collar financiers who will be throwing billions at the industry left and right, will get burnt short term, as this industry fails to build brands the way they expect. Stay nimble on this. That’s my perspective now but who knows? We have a long way to maturity in this industry so I remain open to changing my perspective as more evidence becomes available.\n\nI’m arguing don’t invest in cannabis right? Sort of. We are going to trade cannabis. We see the bubble and we know when it will reach its peak of mania. It’s very easy to predict due to legislation holding up the earning potential for all these companies (STATES act)\\[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2093/text\\]. There are complications for the largest investors in the world due to the technical federal illegality of all the cultivators.

The Russian S.V.R. will surely have used its access to further exploit and gain administrative control over the networks it considered priority targets. For those targets, the hackers will have long ago moved past their entry point, covered their tracks and gained what experts call “persistent access,” meaning the ability to infiltrate and control networks in a way that is hard to detect or remove.\n>\n> While the Russians did not have the time to gain complete control over every network they hacked, they most certainly did gain it over hundreds of them. It will take years to know for certain which networks the Russians control and which ones they just occupy.\n>\n> **The logical conclusion is that we must act as if the Russian government has control of all the networks it has penetrated**. But it is unclear what the Russians intend to do next. The access the Russians now enjoy could be used for far more than simply spying.\n>\n> The actual and perceived control of so many important networks could easily be used to undermine public and consumer trust in data, written communications and services.

USB    m=     1, s=    23 (post: Short the idiots, comment: ['EDIT: I think I misunderstood what you meant by \'update server\' because Orion is used to do administrative tasks, including updating computers on an internal network. Derp. \n\nKeep in mind there\'s two stages to this hack. One was SWI getting hacked so that the (probably) Ruskies could put a backdoor into an Orion update, the other was 18,000 SWI customers getting hacked when they installed that backdoor\'d update. \n\nWhether the leaked FTP credentials led to the hack of SWI itself is unclear. People smarter than me think it\'s unlikely. SWI has no reason to allow a publicly-facing FTP server to access internal infrastructure. It should not be implicitly trusted by SWI, so lateral movement shouldn\'t be possible. Huge emphasis on SHOULD though.\n\nI don\'t know that the leaked FTP server creds allowed anyone to do anything but read (and possibly write) to SWI\'s FTP server. If that account had shell access to the FTP server, and the FTP server wasn\'t isolated from the rest of their infrastructure, then yeah that\'s a possible point of entry into SWI itself. If those credentials only had FTP read/write permissions then the hack of SWI probably wasn\'t done with them. \n\nThe creds may have been involved in the hacking of the customers, but that\'d only be a tiny piece of the puzzle. Putting a binary on that update server isn\'t enough. You have to get targets to run it. IT folks won\'t just download and run totally_not_a_trojan.exe from random FTP servers. IWS customers ran the hackers\' malware because it is part of an official Orion module and runs as part of that module\'s normal operation. Vlad managed to get his malware compiled into the Orion binary itself and then released as part of an official update. They need a lot more than the ability to upload pwn_your_mom.exe to an FTP server to accomplish that.\n\nFurthermore, like I said above, this code has to be cryptographically signed. If you\'ve ever run a new app on your PC and gotten a popup that says "Unknown Publisher" or whatever, that\'s Windows telling you that the app was not cryptographically signed. I haven\'t looked into it but I would expect SolarWinds uses a cryptographic key stored on a special physical USB dongle that has to be plugged into the machine doing the code signing (we have to do this at my company and we just make shitty video games). So the Ruskies didn\'t simply steal the source code, compile their own version with the backdoor, and then sneakily upload it to that FTP server. That binary would have failed the code signing check and never been run, could have been noticed by an engineer, could have been overwritten by a non-hacked binary as part of a normal update, etc. This is further evidence that the attackers compromised SolarWind\'s build infrastructure.\n\nCustomers using Orion would implicitly trust cryptographically signed software updates from the FTP server. That\'s how the attackers got onto SolarWind\'s customers\' networks. From there they absolutely moved laterally. Orion is used to do administration on the network, among other things. Owning it means you own everything else. That\'s one of the reasons this is such a Huge Fucking Deal ^tm. If you\'re a victim of this you\'re looking at wiping all your machines- and possibly throwing them all away because firmware implants are a thing- and then rebuilding your entire infrastructure from scratch. Oof. \n\nThe "good" news is it appears the attackers chose to use as small of a malware footprint as possible, preferring to use stolen credentials to do most of their work, so persistence will be lower. The primary malware payload that Orion delivered is a relatively known quantity so it should be possible to find and remove. Also C2 and data exfil depended on Orion because it provided a plausible cover for the traffic, so cutting those machines off from the network should prevent any more data being stolen. Also the domain that all the data was exfiltrated to has been taken over so any new data is (probably) not going anywhere anyways.', 23, '/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ke4648/short_the_idiots/gg0xlfy/'])

GOOG   m=     4, s=    12 (post: Ready Player GME: Custom-built trailer for all the Gamestop soldiers, comment: ["The headline DD catalysts are in the video, and others are better than I for the details.\n\nMy own personal DD was just going to the mall for something else, and customers were in their store, vs other mall stores that were empty (medium level lockdown level locally). I asked one of the clerks about their PS and Xbox. They were obviously sold out, but they are now keeping such a long wait list for console sales, they are not adding any more names. My understanding is that there will be an announcement mid January from GME on how things are going with console cycle sales.\n\nI think it is the only retail stock I can ever recall owning, as I typically don't like the space.\n\nFor the future, either the board follows Cohen's plan, or get replaced. My impression is that the board will want to get things done and not resign, since it is tough to not do well after a new console cycle, and they can all get a star on their resume even though it was the external times that made the recovery not the board.\n\nI never foresaw Whole Foods getting taken out by Amazon. Why brick and mortar when can deliver?  Because there is sometimes value in a competitive on-the-ground network from an online, when others have a brick and mortar presence.\n\nCompetition for video game platform supremacy similarly is going to be intense in the next 10 years, with MSFT, APPL, GOOG (Stadia) AMZN (Twitch) in particular jockeying for position. Question is whether one of the large players (not APPL) would intervene and take over GME just to give them a few percentage edge on uptake of their particular platform, since $1B is pocket lint for them compared to the value of becoming the Oasis of the future, in a way to ante up against Apple with their Apple stores. The bought GME stores can be a combination of a Genius Bar repair/upgrade shop, showroom, and in-person live competition hub. The stores can run as a loss leader, similar to how Google pretty much gives away a Chromebook hardware to make money on services. MSFT would be my best guess as to who would buy GME, though they own exited retail stores a while back. The value of buying GME vs just starting your own stores is because it is the cutthroat solution, since it takes away the network that is currently selling your competitors products as well as your own. MSFT does this with video game software studios, not only to release their own, but to stop them to releasing them for other platforms.\n\nAnyways, I reckon the next few weeks will bring some drama to this action film of a stock.

[https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/top-producers.html](https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/top-producers.html)\n* ArcelorMittal also hit its $7 billion net debt target at the end of the 3rd quarter, **the lowest level since ArcelorMittal’s creation in 2006 and a point at which the company can start returning cash to shareholders**.\n* The company is poised to sell its U.S. assets in a cash and shares deal with Cleveland-Cliffs Inc for $1.4 billion in a deal that has allowed it to **launch a $500 million share buyback.**\n*  Under the terms of the sale, **ArcelorMittal has received $505 million cash,\xa078 million shares of Cleveland-Cliffs common stock and non-voting preferred stock which is redeemable for approximately 58 million shares of Cleveland-Cliffs common stock or an equivalent amount in cash -** meaning if $CLF performs well, $MT further benefits.\n* $MT has been selling off assets in the US for years to take advantage of currency advantage of manufacturing in Canada and cost labor advantage of manufacturing in Mexico:\n\n**Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:**\n\n*“This transaction is a unique opportunity for ArcelorMittal to unlock significant value for shareholders while retaining exposure to the North American economy through our high-quality NAFTA assets alongside a participation in what will be a stronger, better integrated, US business. I would like to thank all employees of ArcelorMittal USA for their hard work in ensuring the business maintained its reputation as a trusted, quality supplier of steels for American manufacturing. I am confident you will have a bright future with Cleveland-Cliffs.”*\n\n* Favorable valuation achieved for ArcelorMittal USA due to the high synergistic potential of the combined company. The Transaction valuation for ArcelorMittal USA equates to an enterprise value multiple of approximately 6x through-the-cycle EBITDA.\n* ArcelorMittal will participate in the upside potential of the larger combined company, which is more diversified, fully-integrated and has significant synergy potential\n* The deconsolidation of the associated liabilities at ArcelorMittal USA, comprising mostly pension and OPEB liabilities, will improve the Group’s risk profile, reduce net debt and strengthen its capital structure and credit metrics.\n\nLet\'s move on to mining because there are many that claim $VALE is the play because of iron ore.  $VALE is a good play, but $MT as it pertains to mining:\n\n*  $MT is active in the whole value chain, from exploration and development to mining, concentration, pelletizing, rail transport and port operations. With operations that span Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia, we aim to optimize our portfolio so we can deliver results at any point in the economic cycle, and to manage our assets to the highest standards. We are equally driven to mine responsibly and sustainably, minimizing the impact of mining on the natural environment, and working closely with local communities to build skills and social infrastructure to ensure long-term development.\n* We have a geographically diversified portfolio of 14 operating units in Brazil, Bosnia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Liberia, Mexico, Ukraine and United States that in 2019 produced **57.1 million tons of iron ore and 5.5 million tons of coking coal. Our main products include iron ore lump, fines, concentrate pellets and sinter feed, and coking coal, thermal coal and pulverized coal injection (PCI) coal.**\n\n**VERTICAL INTEGRATION -** so the largest steel maker in the world supplies over half of it\'s raw materials - allowing them to cost average down higher ore prices, thus expanding their margins on finished product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Global Reach](https://preview.redd.it/tuywroc1de661.png?width=2442&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dbe6c676ca6d74466ba1c8a478667ebb306f481)\n\n[Vertical Integration and #1 steel maker in the world](https://preview.redd.it/6g9xy2u6de661.png?width=2438&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf5e0e5859ece05b3a2fffbbc8f25f9e632b26e8)\n\n[Innovation](https://preview.redd.it/liqoe8rvce661.png?width=2439&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba733802b0cb55aa3b9b5331e73c0650a5dfbe81)\n\nThat brings me to the current DEMAND>>>>>SUPPLY situation the world is in regarding raw materials and finished goods.  THIS HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE 2005, peaking like a rocket in 2008.  It had more legs in 2008, but the Great Recession put an abrupt end to the party.\n\nHere is where we stand as of last week:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgt45uzbge661.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a4357d0d4adce59d8ca1de95c7d039976e24afd\n\nHere is an overall look of the past 18 years, notice 2008 and current action:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Starting to mirror 2008 action](https://preview.redd.it/37avzrvshe661.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5380d1b84263c0dc7ba7ddbb04f2a7b7d517422)\n\nIn 2008 $MT was trading at the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The run up and peak before the Great Recession collapse](https://preview.redd.it/t1nicl3oie661.png?width=1931&format=png&auto=webp&s=15a38b26fcefa2815baf39e518d917db28795ce0)\n\nThe difference between 2008 and today - there was more uncertainty believe it or not then in 2008 than today.  Banks were going out of business, the total collapse in mortgage backed securities and people walking away from homes.  Who in their right mind would ever want to own a home again?\n\nWell, that has changed dramatically, while things are still a bit uncertain - vaccines are rolling out world-wide.  Interest rates are at all time lows and will be in the US until at least 2023.  The exodus of people from high tax states and cities due to "work from home" changes has created a housing boom in the suburbs and rural areas.  Homes need steel for foundations, fasteners and more importantly large appliances - dishwashers, washers, dryers, stoves, etc.  Have you seen Whirlpool stock this year?  $74 to $188, went over $200 - demand and higher steel prices = higher revenues.  When new homes and communities are built - the infrastructure follows -schools, hospitals, government buildings, shopping - all large projects that use massive amounts of steel.\n\nSpeaking of interest rates, outside of the US in recent years, an increasing number of central banks have resorted to low-rate policies. Several, including the European Central Bank and the central banks of Denmark, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland, have started experimenting with ***negative interest rates*** **—essentially making banks pay to park their excess cash at the central bank. The aim is to encourage banks to lend out those funds instead, thereby countering the weak growth that persisted after the 2008 global financial crisis.** \n\nThe point being to all of this is **THIS IS NOT A LIQUIDITY CRISIS** like we saw in 2008 - banks are printing money at a rate that we are seeing inflation and hyper inflation in commodity prices - the US Dollar Index now stands at the lowest level since January of 2014 and is expected to further decline. A weaker US Dollar buys less in foreign goods, thus further increasing the price of imported goods.\n\nOk, now that I have bored you to death here is the point:\n\n**$MT TAKEAWAYS:**\n\n* Upgraded by SocGen to $39 PT - they doubled EBITDA estimates for 2021 and 2022 **50% above market consensus.**\n* Goldman Sachs keeps buy rating increasing to $29USD PT [https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/ARCELORMITTAL-Gets-a-Buy-rating-from-Goldman-Sachs-32032450/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/ARCELORMITTAL-Gets-a-Buy-rating-from-Goldman-Sachs-32032450/)\n* Jeffries maintains buy rating with $27 PT\n*   [https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/Market-Chatter-ArcelorMittal-Lifts-Hot-Rolled-Coil-Prices-by-EUR50-MT-S-P-Global-Platts-Reports-32039746/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/Market-Chatter-ArcelorMittal-Lifts-Hot-Rolled-Coil-Prices-by-EUR50-MT-S-P-Global-Platts-Reports-32039746/)\n*  ArcelorMittal has held recent discussions with automakers over annual contracts and has been **targeting a €100-120/t increase**, according to market participants. Carmakers negotiating backdated deals have staunchly refused to pay such increases after securing rollovers or slight discounts from other mills. **But those negotiating calendar-year 2021 prices have been left with little room to negotiate, given the rocketing spot market and higher contract settlements with general industry participants**. \n*  The company’s current stock price of a little over $23 reflects a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 6x, which is lower than the average forward P/E multiple of 7.2x for major iron ore miners and much lower than the average forward P/E multiple of 12.8x for the broader metals and mining industry.  **Thus, at this point ArcelorMittal’s stock seems to be undervalued.** It should be $36-$38 based on this alone.\n\nI believe we will see some bigger moves of $MT over the next 6-8 weeks.  \n\nMy PT is $30 to $40 (BULL) by mid-February and believe earnings in February will smash expectations, further gapping up the stock like we saw in 2007-08.\n\nI do not believe we will see $300 again this cycle, but SUPER BULL scenario could be $100, as I now believe based on futures orders now being pushed at to May, there are further legs for increases throughout 2021.  \n\nI like the common stock, based on the undervalue P/E multiple alone.\n\nI love the options for Feb-June based on earnings and anticipation of a blow-out quarter as more is reported daily on steel and shortages.\n\nGood luck!', 1137, '/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh2tvc/mt_a_further_dive_into_why_this_is_the_steel_play/'])
