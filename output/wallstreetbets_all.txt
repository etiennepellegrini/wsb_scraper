I bought a call slightly OTM for mid-April and I'm currently up 125%.\n\nEnough of me bragging, my advice is to find a company/sector that you know more about than the average investor and make mid-/long term options trades that you consider a safe bet. If you think a stock/ETF will increase 30% in the next year, buy a leap 10% OTM.

ACA    m=     1, s=     7 (post: 70k to 1M in 1 year, comment: ["**What are the purchasing habits of a cannabis consumer?**\n\nCannabis is unlike alcohol and tobacco and caffeine. If you are a user please back me up on this or argue with me, I’d appreciate either one. What brand of marijuana do you smoke? Chances are if you grew up drinking you know the brands your crew partied with. If you grew up smoking cigs, you know the brand you liked and you probably still smoke the same thing. From my perspective, cannabis flower is going to be particularly difficult to brand. Typically the smoking process involves grinding whole bud in order to roll your own joint/blunt or pack the pipe/bong. Where is the branding happening?\n\nThe thing I remember when I was smoking regularly is who had that fire, who had the mids, and who had the schwag. Your dealer brands themselves with the quality they provide. I would put up with a lot to get the Humboldt grown fire over the trash one of my buddies had. The funny thing is you can tell immediately just from smoking. The quality of the grow brands itself into your mind. It can be the same exact strain, with the same exact genetics, but if it is grown without the proper knowledge and care the result will be wildly different. Alcohol and cigs and caffeine, it all hits the same pretty much, no matter what your brand is you are consuming a fairly uniform experience. I think of it as a superficial difference vs. a fundamental difference. Expertly grown and crafted cannabis will brand itself. You can put it in a paper bag and users will ask for the paper bag stuff. This is a key concept to understanding where the potential profit is in this industry and who may become the leaders.\n\nFor evidence of this look to Colorado which is one of the most competitive and challenging environments for cannabis businesses to thrive. I recently drove around Denver to a bunch of the top rated recreational dispensaries. The main store that stood out was A Cut Above. Middle of the day on a weekday IIRC I waited in line for an hour. Everywhere else I walked in and I walked out. Part of this is the size and limitations of their store but demand was clearly the highest for their product in the area from what I saw. I haven't had a chance to smoke anything but check out r/COents and ACA is a place that brands itself by the quality it provides. 14er in Boulder does a better job with presentation IMO and seems pretty popular with good offerings as well. If you’re a smoker from CO chime in, I’m sure you may disagree and I’d appreciate your input. \n\nI believe these same principles from the cannabis black market will transfer to the legal market such as I saw in CO. The dealers with schwag or sub par offerings will be laughed at and business will be limited. Essentially cannabis and the properties of cannabis make it a connoisseur product naturally. I think the closest comparison is the craft beer market. Small batches, unique brews/strains, expertly crafted and cared for products will be where the big money/profits are. This is a low margin environment.\n\nThis is why cannabis cultivation is not a good business to invest in. The most successful player will understand these concepts and not overextend their grows. They will create small batches that are tended carefully. Margins aren’t ever going to be great and prices will never be higher than at initial legalization. Can a mega grower provide consistency of product at mass scale? Maybe. Cannabis cultivation just doesn’t suit the timetables of public corporations and their goals to show ever increasing profits and business dominance. Likely the cannabis cultivation winner in terms of revenue will buy a bunch of independent small batch growers alongside a well run and carefully maintained mega grow operation. I do imagine there will be some normalization to higher quality eventually and it is possible at this point we may see brand loyalty differentiate producers. This will take quite a bit of time to develop in my opinion. A lot of the white collar financiers who will be throwing billions at the industry left and right, will get burnt short term, as this industry fails to build brands the way they expect. Stay nimble on this. That’s my perspective now but who knows? We have a long way to maturity in this industry so I remain open to changing my perspective as more evidence becomes available.\n\nI’m arguing don’t invest in cannabis right? Sort of. We are going to trade cannabis. We see the bubble and we know when it will reach its peak of mania. It’s very easy to predict due to legislation holding up the earning potential for all these companies (STATES act)\\[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2093/text\\]. There are complications for the largest investors in the world due to the technical federal illegality of all the cultivators. You are alive during one of the most unique opportunities ever in the markets. You can buy into companies that the largest market participants are hesitating to invest in. Instead of retail chasing these stocks it will be Institutions with billions fighting for a piece of the pie. I believe it will be the largest bubble since the internet. Alongside the Fed destroying our economic future, we will see a cannabis bubble that makes the internet bubble look reasonable.", 7, '/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdvh7l/70k_to_1m_in_1_year/gfyuwoh/'])

When these tickers can uplist to American exchanges we will see an event like when CGC and Tilray uplisted to the major exchanges and got chased up IMO. You want to be in before that happens. American cannabis is going to have huge export potential depending on the grower. Demand is going to outpace supply for quite a while and things are going to look healthy to validate insane multiples. CGC and Tilray saw P/S ratios of 158 and 650 respectively at peak. This is a product of float so we will use CGC since their share structure at the time matches somewhat with the MSO’s I like. TCNNF, CRLBF, GTBIF all have P/S around 10 very roughly  if I’m not mistaken. It is not guaranteed but if we see similar craziness and FOMO that means all would see a 1000- 2000% gain to match that insane multiple. Remember that CGC was objectively a horrible company at that time while Trulieve, Green Thumb, and Cresco are of much higher quality and better run. That’s also assuming no growth.

Strong QoverQ (growth) and continuous responsible raises to ensure continued growth through acquisition. A specialized home depot for the cannabis industry. Their role is supplying large and small producers with the equipment and knowledge necessary to grow the highest quality cannabis. They have the most crucial job in the entire industry as I have outlined above. Quality leads to market superiority. IMO it is between GRWG and Hawthorne (a subsidiary of Scott’s Miracle Gro (SMG)) to dominate this market. This is a massive international market these two need to address. Their business is directly responsible for the success of dispensaries so there is certainly risk if one fails to execute. Considering my theory on small craft cultivation dominating markets I believe the hydroponics outfitter that takes the best approach to addressing this community will end up the winner over time. In the meantime this is a low float rocketship. Roughly 50M shares outstanding. It’s potential is comparable to Tilray and lets be reasonable and say a 200 P/S multiple. GRWG P/S is roughly 8. The upside during a bubble is insane at over 2000%. Tilray P/S was 600+ at peak.\n\nThe way to play this since GRWG is Nasdaq listed is to be heavy into GRWG. It will peak and run harder than the otc/csx listed tickers. Sell that spike into States act news most likely. We are going to know when the bubble starts to peak. Keep track of P/S and sell a bit along the way up. Citron is going to come in and burst the bubble, you already know how it goes. Rotate into OTC tickers before uplist and possibly ride that wave another 100+%. \n\nI do believe there is a possibility for a pullback within the next few months. Obviously everything is running hot. GRWG should see support at 30, 25, and strength at 22/20. It’s difficult to predict short term price movement here but I am confident in predicting long term upside of 300% from current levels for all equities I hold and have recommended today.

He takes over in January. \n\nConcurrent with the CEO search announcement they said they were exploring splitting out their managed services division\n\nLeadership made some big stock sales shortly before the announcement \n\nQ3 earnings said they expected new customers to go down in Q4 2020 but they expect a bunch of new contracts in Q1 2021. I\'m gonna guess a lot of potential customers are questioning those purchases \n\nThe hotfix they expected to release yesterday still hadn\'t shipped as of this afternoon \n\nThey think the attack was via their build system. This should not happen. Very bad. And I doubt they\'d have different build systems for different products, so how do we know they weren\'t compromised at some point as well? \n\nLast year, a security researcher alerted the company that anyone could access SolarWinds\' update server (which is how the compromised updates that contained the attack were served) by using the password "solarwinds123"\n\nSounds like big people/culture problems \n\nNew CEO has a lot to clean up and needs to convince all their existing customers why they should stay in addition to pursuing new business \n\nWe haven\'t started to get disclosures from the affected companies. Those won\'t be good for the stock or trust. \n\nAll this erodes a shitton of trust and makes me 🐻\n\nFireEye however seems to have done a stellar job figuring out the issue after identifying the vulnerability and is leading from the front in technical analysis, reporting, and transparency.

The Russian S.V.R. will surely have used its access to further exploit and gain administrative control over the networks it considered priority targets. For those targets, the hackers will have long ago moved past their entry point, covered their tracks and gained what experts call “persistent access,” meaning the ability to infiltrate and control networks in a way that is hard to detect or remove.\n>\n> While the Russians did not have the time to gain complete control over every network they hacked, they most certainly did gain it over hundreds of them. It will take years to know for certain which networks the Russians control and which ones they just occupy.\n>\n> **The logical conclusion is that we must act as if the Russian government has control of all the networks it has penetrated**. But it is unclear what the Russians intend to do next. The access the Russians now enjoy could be used for far more than simply spying.\n>\n> The actual and perceived control of so many important networks could easily be used to undermine public and consumer trust in data, written communications and services.

USB    m=     1, s=    22 (post: Short the idiots, comment: ['EDIT: I think I misunderstood what you meant by \'update server\' because Orion is used to do administrative tasks, including updating computers on an internal network. Derp. \n\nKeep in mind there\'s two stages to this hack. One was SWI getting hacked so that the (probably) Ruskies could put a backdoor into an Orion update, the other was 18,000 SWI customers getting hacked when they installed that backdoor\'d update. \n\nWhether the leaked FTP credentials led to the hack of SWI itself is unclear. People smarter than me think it\'s unlikely. SWI has no reason to allow a publicly-facing FTP server to access internal infrastructure. It should not be implicitly trusted by SWI, so lateral movement shouldn\'t be possible. Huge emphasis on SHOULD though.\n\nI don\'t know that the leaked FTP server creds allowed anyone to do anything but read (and possibly write) to SWI\'s FTP server. If that account had shell access to the FTP server, and the FTP server wasn\'t isolated from the rest of their infrastructure, then yeah that\'s a possible point of entry into SWI itself. If those credentials only had FTP read/write permissions then the hack of SWI probably wasn\'t done with them. \n\nThe creds may have been involved in the hacking of the customers, but that\'d only be a tiny piece of the puzzle. Putting a binary on that update server isn\'t enough. You have to get targets to run it. IT folks won\'t just download and run totally_not_a_trojan.exe from random FTP servers. IWS customers ran the hackers\' malware because it is part of an official Orion module and runs as part of that module\'s normal operation. Vlad managed to get his malware compiled into the Orion binary itself and then released as part of an official update. They need a lot more than the ability to upload pwn_your_mom.exe to an FTP server to accomplish that.\n\nFurthermore, like I said above, this code has to be cryptographically signed. If you\'ve ever run a new app on your PC and gotten a popup that says "Unknown Publisher" or whatever, that\'s Windows telling you that the app was not cryptographically signed. I haven\'t looked into it but I would expect SolarWinds uses a cryptographic key stored on a special physical USB dongle that has to be plugged into the machine doing the code signing (we have to do this at my company and we just make shitty video games). So the Ruskies didn\'t simply steal the source code, compile their own version with the backdoor, and then sneakily upload it to that FTP server. That binary would have failed the code signing check and never been run, could have been noticed by an engineer, could have been overwritten by a non-hacked binary as part of a normal update, etc. This is further evidence that the attackers compromised SolarWind\'s build infrastructure.\n\nCustomers using Orion would implicitly trust cryptographically signed software updates from the FTP server. That\'s how the attackers got onto SolarWind\'s customers\' networks. From there they absolutely moved laterally. Orion is used to do administration on the network, among other things. Owning it means you own everything else. That\'s one of the reasons this is such a Huge Fucking Deal ^tm. If you\'re a victim of this you\'re looking at wiping all your machines- and possibly throwing them all away because firmware implants are a thing- and then rebuilding your entire infrastructure from scratch. Oof. \n\nThe "good" news is it appears the attackers chose to use as small of a malware footprint as possible, preferring to use stolen credentials to do most of their work, so persistence will be lower. The primary malware payload that Orion delivered is a relatively known quantity so it should be possible to find and remove. Also C2 and data exfil depended on Orion because it provided a plausible cover for the traffic, so cutting those machines off from the network should prevent any more data being stolen. Also the domain that all the data was exfiltrated to has been taken over so any new data is (probably) not going anywhere anyways.', 22, '/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ke4648/short_the_idiots/gg0xlfy/'])

I asked one of the clerks about their PS and Xbox. They were obviously sold out, but they are now keeping such a long wait list for console sales, they are not adding any more names. My understanding is that there will be an announcement mid January from GME on how things are going with console cycle sales.\n\nI think it is the only retail stock I can ever recall owning, as I typically don't like the space.\n\nFor the future, either the board follows Cohen's plan, or get replaced. My impression is that the board will want to get things done and not resign, since it is tough to not do well after a new console cycle, and they can all get a star on their resume even though it was the external times that made the recovery not the board.\n\nI never foresaw Whole Foods getting taken out by Amazon. Why brick and mortar when can deliver?  Because there is sometimes value in a competitive on-the-ground network from an online, when others have a brick and mortar presence.\n\nCompetition for video game platform supremacy similarly is going to be intense in the next 10 years, with MSFT, APPL, GOOG (Stadia) AMZN (Twitch) in particular jockeying for position. Question is whether one of the large players (not APPL) would intervene and take over GME just to give them a few percentage edge on uptake of their particular platform, since $1B is pocket lint for them compared to the value of becoming the Oasis of the future, in a way to ante up against Apple with their Apple stores. The bought GME stores can be a combination of a Genius Bar repair/upgrade shop, showroom, and in-person live competition hub. The stores can run as a loss leader, similar to how Google pretty much gives away a Chromebook hardware to make money on services. MSFT would be my best guess as to who would buy GME, though they own exited retail stores a while back. The value of buying GME vs just starting your own stores is because it is the cutthroat solution, since it takes away the network that is currently selling your competitors products as well as your own. MSFT does this with video game software studios, not only to release their own, but to stop them to releasing them for other platforms.\n\nAnyways, I reckon the next few weeks will bring some drama to this action film of a stock.

Facing a demand >>> supply situation not as great as we are at today. \n\nI expect MT stock to increase by a minimum of 300-500% in very short order.  \n\nThis is for a trade only and not long time hold. \n\nIt will increase over the next 8-12 weeks and accelerate after earnings until supply catches up with demand and it will. \n\nIt did and the stock dropped to $78 by October 2008. \n\nIm telling you this one is going to MOON. \n\nI have common stock but also have a VERY SIGNIFICANT position in June 18 2021 $25c \n\nI am going to retire on this. \n\nSchnitzer Steel\n\nhttps://www.schnitzersteel.com\n\nMassive recycling play here - these are the guys that supply scrap for steel manufacturing to companies that are “mini-mill” Electric Arc Furnaces that melt steel scrap and make rebar and other steel products. \n\nScrap prices just increased here in the United States by $90/ton - the largest increase since 2008. \n\nIn May 2008 It was trading at over $100/share. \n\nToday it is $29/share. \n\nI have common and smaller option positions. \n\nThis too will skyrocket and then trade out in early summer. \n\nVALE \n\nVale like, MT is vertically integrated with mining and manufacturing. \n\nMay 2008 - $40/share\n\nToday it is $16 share and on a blue sky trajectory - it will be $30 by March, maybe sooner.  \n\nNajarian is all over options on this one. \n\nGoogle anything regarding “steel prices” and all you are going to see is exactly what I’m telling you - we are going to see all-time highs in steel prices next year and steel stocks are quickly going to move hot and fast.  \n\nMT - is my biggest play and I think you will see a lot more sector rotation out of tech and into materials betting further on stimulus and infrastructure spending.', 47, '/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdq5qu/i_read_a_post_about_mt_this_morning_bought_a_shit/gfzn7t9/'])

As far as open sourcing this code goes: I’m hoping to post the code freely for my script but it’s just an real-time, in-place, ranking algorithm and it’s not much use without the data. I’ve briefly chatted with the mods about the best way to offer this data/script. One recommendation was Google docs and Apps Script. I just need to see how large of a file the 1.4 million options snapshot would be to see if that’s possible. I can always offer a top 1000 subset or something. Lastly, my vendor is talking to the legal and entitled data team to make sure I can do this. It will have to be 15 mins delayed (and probably updated once per hour) but that’s the only way around the limitations of the entitled data.\n\nWhat I can’t emphasize enough though is that this will be free, simple, and neutral. With this, I’m just hoping to provide some hard to come by options data in the hopes it can help! \n\nAlso, the banned ticker list is in the WSB wiki.', 53, '/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kfuzyw/i_wrote_a_script_that_tracks_the_days_highest/ggax2a7/'])

Those posts you see always make it to the top because they’re the real 1% of this sub. \n\nFrom what I’ve seen most people here play with some options, but have stocks as long term holds. I use 2-5% of my portfolio to be in options. I’ve been riding MAD,NVDA, and MU up for the last few years in stocks in order to give myself some room for options. If my options expire or I lose them I wait until I can save up more from my next few, but I don’t do weeklies, and always sell my options a week before they expire so no matter what I don’t lose something useless. \n\nCurrent positions:\n\nHella MU calls for 01/2021 and 06/2021\nSome F calls for 6/2021\nCRM calls for 03/2021\n\nStocks:\nQCOM,MU,AMD,NVDA\n\nnew adds: GME (🚀🚀),PLTR,MT\n\nTotal portfolio under 80k but started at 20k so I’m OK with that return after 6 years.\n\n\nedit: yes I work in software, no I’m not in sales', 2, '/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kgi9gg/how_rich_are_you_autists_playing_with_30k100k_etc/ggi5jrj/'])
